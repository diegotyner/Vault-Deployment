# 📗 -> 11/5: The Keys to the Castle: The Role of Neurosurgery in Understanding How the Human Brain Works
## 🎤 Vocab
**NS** - Novelty selective
**FS** - Familiarity selective
**VS** - Visually Selective
**PAC** - Phase Amplitude Coupling cells
## ❗ Information
### Hippocampus
Plays a big role in spatial location and memory, multiple forms
Has neurons for
- Novelty
- Familiarity
- Grid cells


## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
### Visually Selective Neurons
Don't care whether an image is new or old, code for a specific higher level input

![[NS-FS-Decision-Making.png]]
- Decision making of novelty does NOT take place in the hmpc, likely in the frontal lobe


### Episodic Memories
Boundary cells, event cells
- More data and info, also information on how things are being parsed
	- Background theta rythms
	- Rythmic/Cyclic ....

### Memory Storage and Access
Single Cell -> Grandmother Cell
- Not true, stroke data shows that you don't just forget your grandmother after losing one neuron
Network -> Reactivation
- Network of information, configurations
- If you activate a specific network, get a specific memory
Flexible Network Geometry -> Dynamic/Stochastic System
- A high dimensional technique, reduces to dimensions, measures movement of factors
- If parallel to each other, maintains a certain relationshionship
- If orthogonal, represent different types of behavior
- Very important in neuroscience
	- Very dense, could spend 45-60 minutes on data points

### Working Memory Task
When you're encoding a task, increased firing rate
Retrieving, increased firing rate
Subset of neurons that increase firing during maintenance phase

Process mediated by frontal lobe, not MTL

*Persistent activity during WM maintenance predicts long-term memory formation in the human hippocampus*

Studies show there is some frontal lobe interactions with working memory, and encoding of long-term memory
> Long-term memory pretty short in studies, as short as 30 minutes

### Cognitive Control Tasks
Flanker tasks, arrow tasks
- Neurons that detect errors
- Performance monitoring neurons
- Cognitive control neurons
Neurons that show task specificity, and others that are invariant and respond to everything


### PAC
Phase Amplitude Coupling cells in HA coordinate frontal activity and improve population geomtry and response fidelity

### Flexible recruitment of memory-based choice representations by the human medial frontal cortex
People doing one study, quickly switch to another task, then immediately switch back
Hippocampus encodes ground truth


### Abstract representations emerge in human hippocampal neurons during inference
People don't need all the facts, we can infer
Infer weather, from what people are wearing

> [!NOTE] New recording technologies will revolutionize the field
> Go from recording 5/6 neurons to 100s
> Neuropixels for instance
> -Better for animals though


> [!NOTE] New tech -> New Opportunities
> Closed loop stimulation, only fire in response to a seizure for instance

### Other issues
- Ethics
	- Human experimentation with no benefit to patient
	- Need IRB approval, consent, and more
	- Need a GOOD reason to experiment (not just putting one in because you want to poke around)
- Funding
- Partnering with industry
- Increased interest in psychiatric disorders - many new opportunities
	- PTSD (interaction with the amygdala)

### Advice
Mostly for neurosurgeons:

Pick a topic and stay with it
- Getting started takes time
You CANNOT do this alone
- At least not these days
- Establish a partnership with your neurophysiologists, neurologists, others
Simple tasks
- Data interpretation is hard
Be patient (in the OR)
- OR cases will take longer, but this is your lab
Be active and involved
It's fun!
