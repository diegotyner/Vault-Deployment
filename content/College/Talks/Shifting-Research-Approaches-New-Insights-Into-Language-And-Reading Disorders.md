## ❗ Information



## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
> Language and reading are what make us uniquely human. First responsibility of children are to learn these tasks.

### 1st Part of Talk - Dyslexia
Characteristics of *Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) and Dyslexia*
- Unexpected difficulty (not attributable to another known cause)
- Defined by arbitrary cutoffs along a continuum of abilities
- Neurobiological cause, partially heritable
- "Developmental" (not acquired)
- Benefit from early identification and intervention
Existing diagnostic methods are not accurate enough, typically we have to wait for children to fail before helping them

3 principles to help turn a new page:
- Characterizing heterogeneity rather than assuming similarity
- Assessing the multiple factors that shape neurodevelopment
- Starting earlier in life and assessing naturalistic context

Assumption that dyslexia is a phonological core deficit model of dyslexia

Rapid automatized naming (RAN) as a core deficit/subtype in dyslexia
- RAN is the efficiency with which one can name an array of familiar items (colors, letters, etc.)
	- Typically measured by speed of processing
	- Very quick to give, can be done in 30 seconds and its one of the best predictors of dyslexia
- Reflects multiple processes and automaticity needed for reading

RNA and PA deficit subtypes differ in their brain activation during reading
📷

Did an ERP task where Mismatch Negativity (MMN) 
- MMN separately reflects RAN and PA

Meta-analysis of RAN as a dyslexia screening measure

Early RAN relates to later reading: a new meta-analysis
- n=10,513 participants from 67 studies
- Pre-K / K -> Grades 1-4
	- Types of reading measures
	- Practical screening considerations
		- Types of RAN grids, items in grid, number of grids, etc.
		- Time of year assessed, etc.
- Found:
	- No significant effect of RAN task factors/layout
	- Or of child/sample factors
		- Child age
		- risk status of sample

### Second part of Talk - Language
DLD - Developmental Language Disorder

Child assessment is not enough to identify DLD

Multiple influences on language development and DLD risk: The When to Worry About Language Study
- Language or reading disorder
- Mental health disorder
A high amount of kids presenting with one will present with the other as well. 

Development of Late Talkers-Remitted (normal late talkers) vs Late Talkers-Persistent (language disorders) is difficult
- Trajectories are almost identical up until age 24
- 64% normal trajectory / 25% remitted / 11% persistent

Late talkers are 2x more likely to have frequent and severe temper tantrums

Social EEG: Naturalistic measures during parent-child interactions
- Put EEG caps on kids (and parents because kids comply better lol) and measure brain waves during natural interactions
- Contexts elicit different types of dyadic interaction
- Behavioral codes are linked to EEG data
- Assess neural responses and synchrony in relation to behavior

Predicted changes during social engagement:
- Alpha Suppression = Visual Attention and Alertness
- Theta Enhancement = Emotional arousal, novel object exploration and social information processing

Results:
- Difference between movie and social condition showed a systematic decrease in alpha (p < .001)
- Increase in theta from movie to social (p< .004)

📷

Next steps are to use these for multimodal prediction of later language and mental health outcomes
- Language trajectories
- Irritability
- Cohort/pandemic effects
- Environment/caregiver factors
- Child social EEG and MMN
- Dyadic synchrony during EEG and MMN


HBCD - HEALthy Brain and Child Development
- Play on ABCD / Babies - Brains - Bright Futures is the tag line
- HEAL - drug related org?
- Largest ever longitudinal study of brain and behavior
Gets behavior, biosensors, EEG data, and more

> Embracing heterogeneity, considering their ecosystem of development, and starting earlier have helped identifying language and reading disorders, with more discoveries to come
