## 🎤 Vocab



## ❗ Information
### Description
**Dr. Anand Shankar**, Postdoctoral Fellow at The Laboratory for Intracranial Neurophysiology led by Dr. Jack Lin, will present on *Dr. Elizabeth Johnson*'s research prior to her seminar talk. The following paper will be presented:

Dissociable oscillatory theta signatures of memory formation in the developing brain
- [Link](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35172128/) - [Full](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982222001154?via%3Dihub)

Uses [Bayes Factor Estimation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/bayes-factor)
Uses **ECoG**

## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
Interactions between MTL and PFC
- Analyze theta oscillation
	- Identify two, slow and fast theta
	- Each play a unique role in memory processing

Strength and patern of connectiions between brain regions change significantly during development
- Understanding connectivity is vital for studying how development of the brain influence cognitive functions and abilities

### Memory
Not a function of a signle brain region, interaction among different ones
- Interaction betweens MTL and PFC vital
MTL vital in forming new episodic memories
PFC involved in higher order cognitive processes
Interactions between em mature with age. 


Brain Rythms (BRs) help to coordinate firingpatterns of neurons in different regios. 
- Theta rythms particulalry important for memory formation and retrieval
	- Slow theta (~2 are linked to memory integration and attention control)
	- Fast theta oscillations associating with WM and exec control

### Study
This study uses *ECoG*

1. A task of studying visual scenes, classifying indoor/outdoor
2. Recognition test
4 possible responses, hit, miss, etc.

Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI) analysis
- structural connectivity?

Amplitude Coupling (AC) and Phase Locking ? (PLC)
Inter regional phase amplitude coupling (PAC)

IFG / MFG / SFG ?

no clue what the heck happened at any point onwards

Review with Dr. Lin

Hard to see if memories formed in brain, so participants must go through learning the visual scenes. After the 1. Study Block, we move to the 2. Recognition Test. Here is where we evaluate if memory successfully ormed.
**subsequent memory effect** - common way of studying if a memory is formed or not. Seeing the memory patterns / brain patterns 

hit - miss.
