## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
### Electrophysiological Correlates of Willed Attention
> What do you do? - from family over & over again

#### Attention
William James 1890 quote. "Everyone knows what attention is."
Operational Def:
- Attention is the ability to focus one's awareness on relevant events and objects while ignoring distractions

##### Background: Voluntary attention
Posner task:
- Primary way to test voluntary attention
- Attend right or left
- Cue -> SOA -> Target -> REsponse
- SOA - ~~synchronous~~ stimulus onset asynchrony?
*He doesn't think this is a good way to study attention*

##### **Willed** attention
- Cue -> SOA -> Target -> Response -> SOA -> Report
- Bengson et al. 2014
In posner task you aren't making a choice. Doing what told.
Instead, generate your own decision. This is the crux of willed atention

> Self-initiated attnetion, in the abscence of external cues
> MInimized external influence, pushing for internally-driven attentional shift


##### Known neural mechanisms of willed attention (EEG)
Predictive alpha-band activity *precedes* the onset of a cue
- Signal in the brain is biasing decision to attend before the prompt to choose occurs

(-800 - 0) Found a significant difference in the brain predicting their choice. See what their brain is going to choose on a trial by trial basis.
(-1700 - -900) Found that this effect vanishes


##### Why study?
- BCI
	- Could predict choices before their presented? didn't understand
- Free will
	- Libet's work about intention to act originating before conscious awareness of wanting to move finger

##### Electrophysiological Correlates of Willed Attention
- Temporal dynamics of covert willed attention
- ~~Overt willed attention in visual search~~
- ~~Color-willed attention~~

##### Experiment 1 - Temporal dynamics of covert willed attention
- Filly willed attention
	- Participants directing and redirecting attention whenever they wanted. Not being directed by experimenter
	- Decision to shift attention *when* and *where*
- Analysis focused relative to button press
	- Signaling active attention

**Alpha** - To pay attention in right, you have to inhibit left
- You will see more alpha band power when you are inhibiting something
	- More in left, less in right

**SVM Decoding**
- Feed in classes of data.
- Provide a set ratio of data to training an test.
- SVM distinguishes between classes (hyperplane).
- Cross-validation (shuffle train and test and run again).
- Compare true labels with predicted labels.
- Compare test against chance.


##### Button Press Decoding
- Epoched relative to the button press
	- Over 19 occipital electrodes
- Shows a ramp-up in decodability to the onset of the button press
- Gradual ramp-down post button-press

CSD Analyses
- Alpha band CSD topographic maps
- Alpha band CSD posterior electrode decoding
Mu rythm over motor cortex predicting button press?
- Did a control, did not find highly significant findings


#### Conclusion
- Developed a unique paradigm that breaks out of the cue-to-target standard
- Replicaed the classic alpha-lateralization found in cued attention without cues
	- First study to do so; important for future BCIs
> Research is EXPENSIVE. Running a lab burns money. Land space, equipment, participants...

### Q&A
Pressing a button small enough for no artifact. Motor signal in brain is a factor though.

Rock Paper Scissors intention study.

Decision network stuff?
