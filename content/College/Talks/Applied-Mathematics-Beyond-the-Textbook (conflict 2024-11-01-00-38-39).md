## ‚ùó Information
### Overview
Optimization <- Information theoretic complexity studies
infinite dim opt in general metric space -> MCMC sampling
"Applied math beyond the textbook"? Diffusion model Autodiff PDE solver
> Many opportunities to exploit connections between topics and disciplines


MCMC struggles with multi-modality in the target distribution
- Borrow ideas from generative modeling: optimal stochastic control / optimal transport to steer a trajectory from $v \to \pi$ using machine learning

### Paradigm Shift
Many high profile successes: (insert photo)
- Not just dumping more data, also ingenuity on how to implement ~~inductive?~~ bias

### Excited
Particularly excited about
- Theoretically: the connection between optimization, sampling, physics-inspired dynamical system (e.g., HMC, momentum), mean-filed game goes much deeper
- Computationally: bring powerful function fitting NN-architecture to solve more traditional tasks in sampling, control, PDE etc., is changing many areas of science
- Applications: in climate modeling (PDE), single-cell genomics (optimal transport), drug discovery & material design (sampling, generative modeling) 


## ‚úíÔ∏è -> Scratch Notes
Prox step: Way to go between iterates. Steps toward optimization
