# 📗 -> 10/2: Brain Taxonomy

[Talk Link](https://neuroengineering.ucdavis.edu/events/neuroengineering-medicine-seminar-towards-taxonomy-large-scale-brain-networks)
> Dr. Lucina Q. Uddin currently directs the Brain Connectivity and Cognition Laboratory and the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience Analysis Core in the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior at UCLA. She will present a talk titled Towards a Taxonomy of Large-Scale Brain Networks. 


## 🎤 Vocab




## ❗ Information
Small summary

## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
Visual Network
Default Network
Frontal Parietal Control Network / 
Salience Network


> [!NOTE] 
> Brain activation is a bit of an inkblot test

We bring our background to an interpretation of activation
- Cingulo-opercular network
- salience network
- ventral \[attention\] network


Different identified salience networks seem to not have much in common

### Model of Neurocognitive Network Dynamics
The dynamic switching of networks (middle state of switching from default to attention for example) plays a massive role as well
1) Medial frontoparietal (default network)
2) ...
3) Attention


**Insular Cortex** - Lots of different paradigms bring activation here
usually if Insula goes up, ACC goes up, so can think as network


Methods for computing functional brain dynamics
- Sliding windows
- K-means clustering


> How is a functional brain network defined?
> How many functional brain networks are there?

### Moving away from functional name
> Naming functionally makes it hard to find networks with similar biological signatures, as well as biasing perspectives

Visual Network -> Occipital Network (ON)
Motor / Somatomotor Network -> Pericentral Network (PN)
Attention Ntwk -> Dorsal Frontoparietal Ntwk (D-FPN)
Control Ntwk -> Lateral Frontoparietal Ntwk (L-FPN)
Salience Ntwk -> Midcingulo-insular Ntwk (M-CIN)
- Leave the salience guesswork out it
Default Mode -> Medial Frontoparietal Network (M-FPN)


> [!warning] Issues
> Dynamics? Tern-individual variability? Subcortical brain regions? Network fractionation, subsystems, hierarchies?


Networks identified with ICA

Parcelation vs Voxels
- Parcels > Voxels, voxels noisy
- Glacel's definitions aren't perfect, but they're standardized
	- People box themselves into it, but its not a perfect definition



### Toolkit that tests how much neural data aligns with existing network atlases
**The Network Correspondence Toolbox**
Techniques used:
- Dice Overlap Test? 
- Spin Test?


Definition of functional network?
- Networks 
- If you have data, do ICA on it, you will get out networks. These are usually what people call networks. Then after, people will name them by cognitive psychology terms. ICA spits out maps, not necessarily networks. 
- For the atlases, they use different algos. Divide them up when functionality abruptly changes, or other methods
