## ❗ Information
Small summary



## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
### Current Treatments
Psych Disorders:
- Medication and psychotherapy (SSRIs, CBT)
Neurodegenerative Diseases
- Managing symptoms primarily
	- Drugs, therapies, lifestyle modifications
- No know cures :(

### Technology and BCIs
Neuroprosthetics:
- Robotic arm
- Cochlear implants

#### Neuralink
Neurological Disorders:
- Parkisons, epilepsy
- BCI/BMI, for paptients with drug-resistant epilepsy
- Interrupr or even preent seizures

Brain Injuries/Stroke
- Record brain signals, send to external device, and deliver appropriate isgnals to desired muscles

Cognitive Abilities
- Improve memory, learning, decision making
- Remote communication by using brain activity to control devices

Pros:
- Improve accessibility for people with disabilities and neurological disorders
- Improved ability to learn and process info
Cons:
- Imprecise
	- Cannot detect single neuron activity, only group activity at present
- No long term research
- Expensive

#### Deep Brain Stimulation
**DBS**
- Electrodes implanted near key regions of the  brain
- Meant to correct brain activity

DBS treats:
- Parkisons
- Tremors
- Epilepsy
- OCD, tourettes
and more!

Pros:
- Reduces symptoms
- Reduces need for medication
- Potential for long term improvements
Cons:
- Invasive
- Results not immediate
- Usually a last resort

#### Neurofeedback for Autism
Neurofeedback:
- Non-invasive EEG therapy
- Brainwave monitoring with EEG sensors
- Visual/Auditory cues provide feedback

Potential benefits:
- Improved attention and focus etc.
Limitations
- Range of responses
- Vary between individuals
- Accessibilitty and cost

#### VR therapies
Originally used for phobia treatments, but now can be used for PTSD, social and emotional skills, and anxiety and deppresion
Pros:
- More mobile
- More confidential
Cons:
- Data privacy
- Can be expensive
- Technical
- Difficult

#### Ultrasound for Alzheimer's
Pathtology:
- Accelerated buildup of amyloid plaque and tau proteins -> inefficient connections
	- Disrupts neural signals
Treatment:
- Amyloid antibody immunotherapies (Aducanumab)
	- Helps the brain's natural immune cells (microglia) clear amyloid plaques more effectively

Problem:
- Hard to get medicine to the affected area
	- Blood Brain Barrier (BBB)
Solution
- Use low intensity focused unltrasound in conjunction with microscopic air bubles to temporarily open the BBB
	- Sound waves create little gaps in the BBB
- If used after injection of immunotherapy drugs, reduction in amyloid plaque is signficiantly increased
	- More medicine delivered to the area

##### Prenatal EO Alzheimer's Detection
How it's done:
- Pregnant patient goes through genetic testing
	- Indicated for patients with a family history of EO AD
- Presence of Apolipoprotein E -> significant chance (40-65%) that embryo will develop Alzheimer's


#### Wegovy and Ozempic
Semaglutide mimics GLP-1 (hormone regulating blood sugar)
Semaglutide vs. other antidiabetic drugs on neurological/psychological outcomes:
- Not associated with increased risk for most conditions
- May be associated with decreased cognitive decline
Some studies show improved learning ability and decreased amyloid plaques in mice

#### Psychedelic Therapies
Induce neuroplasticity
- Rapid increase in synaptogenesis after small doses
Treat stress disorders that cause loss of dendritic spines
- TR depression, OCD, PTSD, etc.
