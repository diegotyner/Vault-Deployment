### Talk 1: New Genetic Technologies Reveal the Inner Lives of Neurons
**Alex Nord**
1:25: Talk Qs:
• How does DNA → brain
• What are cell types in brain
• How do mutations change neurons & behavior
• How can they be leveraged

*CRISPR/CAS* can edit the genome
Works through: 
1) *Cas9 endonuclease* can do a double strand break of DNA
2) RNA loaded by Cas can read read along the DNA

After this you can cause:
1) Random mutations (virology usefulness)
2) Gene editing

*CHD8* - Key gene they're studying, thought to cause brain overgrowth. 
- Autism?


*CRISPRa* - (Activational)
*CRISPRi* - (Inhibitory)
- tools to turn genes on & off

*ASOs* - Antisense Oligonucleotides
- Change translation

DNA
  ↓   ← Crispr
RNA
  ↓   ← ASOs
Protein

Properties of single cells: scRNA-seq
![[scRNA-seq-Revealing-Properties-of-Cells.jpg|800]]

Access & manipulate single neurons?
- AAVs
*AAV* = adeno-associated virus, non-immunogenic
*Recombinant* = change the genetic material so virus can't copy itself

Virus payload of DNA
DNA to be expressed in cell

### Talk 2: Leveraging Stem Cell models to Shed Light on Neurodegenerative Diseases
**Martine Therrien**

![[Microglia-in-Neurodegeneration.jpg|600]]
Age dependent neurodegenerative diseases
- ALS
- Alzeihmers
- Parkinson's

#### Alzheimers will be continued
Its very prominent:
@ 45 years old, 1/5 women and 1/10 men will have it
- 2/3 of alzheimers victims are women

Some treatments, but mostly attributed to lifestyle as a remedy
- Over 100 risk genes identified

*Pluripotent* - Capable of developing into multiple different cells
*iPSC* - Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells

Brain is more than neurons:
- Microglia
- Astrocytes
- Oligodendrocytes
- ...

Amyloid beta is floated as a potential treatment

Microglia around amyloid plaque? 
- APP creates amyloid?

Shown a cool video of microglia swarming a laser injury
- They immediately engulf it

*APOE* - Genetic risk factor and disease microglia marker
- Produces lipid droplets? Fat? 

To study why some microglia are diseased and others aren't:
- *link gene expression to function*


Villages to study hundreds of donors simultaneuosly, cut down on manpower of seperating them into their own dish:

### Talk 3: Emerging Deep Brain Stimulation Therapies for Parkinson's Disease 
**Carina R. Oehrn**
> Talk seems to be about this paper: [Chronic adaptive deep brain stimulation versus conventional stimulation in Parkinson’s disease: a blinded randomized feasibility trial | Nature Medicine](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03196-z)

`came in a few minutes late :(`

![[aDBS-Methods-Slide.jpg|600]]
- *STN* - Subthalamic Nucleus

Why aren't these treatments more common?
- New tech is still emerging

Chronic Adaptive DBS: 
![[aDBS-Trial-Timeline.jpg|600]]

Neural signal biomarkers of symptom states:
- Gamma oscillations fluctate with most bothersome symptoms, a precursor

*aDBS* -  adaptive DBS

Stimulation-stimulation gamma power fluctuates at home during constant stimulation

Article about the technology, testimonial - [A Personalized Brain Pacemaker for Parkinson’s - The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/health/parkinsons-brain-pacemaker.html)



![[Non-Motor-Symptoms-in-Parkinsons-Disease.jpg|600]]

Different frequencies of DBS can be beneficial:
- Theta stimulation can help WM
- Gamma stimulation helps motor abilities

Q&A Notes:
> This is novel (the adaptive part)
> Most are one way, only stimulating. Recording and adapting has shown potential. 
> Also, saves time in adjusting/tuning stimulation. These tend to be long 1 hour sessions every 3 months

Tremors are a weird symptom?
- Auditory stimulation at a frequency has shown potential. Putting the good frequencies in the brain through sound. 
	- The only symptom it seemed to improve
- Grows resistant to DBS


### Talk 4: Model-Based Control: A New Stimulation Approach for Treating Neurological and Psychiatric Diseases?
**Jochen Ditterich**

Role of computational models in neuroscience?
- Fundamental neuroscience (understanding neural mechanisms)
- Translational applications (therapeutic neuromodulations)

Engineers approach to controlling dynamic systems:
![[Engineering-Approach-To-Controlling-Technical-System.jpg|600]]

In the brain instead:
- Record neural activity
- Act on the brain (electrical stim)

![[Neuro-Engineering-Controller-Approach.jpg|600]]

Do a model task, and record from parietal association cortex

He explains dynamic systems models and vector flow fields

*Model Based Control* - Understanding the dynamic system, and taking 'smart' routes to desired outcomes (avoiding heavy resistance, etc.)
