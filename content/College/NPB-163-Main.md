## 🔶 Course Description
> Registrar:
> Concepts and techniques in systems neuroscience: e.g., measuring and manipulating neural activity, structure of neocortex, sensory processing, motor control, storage of information, neural codes, neural mechanisms underlying cognitive functions


### Course goals:
Develop an understanding for
- what systems neuroscience is, what kind of scientific questions are being asked, and what experimental techniques are used to address these questions.
- how neurons code information about sensory events or planned actions.
- the problems that need to be solved by sensory and motor systems and how these systems are organized.
- the relationship between structure and function of different parts of the brain (neocortex, basal ganglia, cerebellum).
- neural mechanisms that support the short-term and long-term storage of information.
- neural mechanisms underlying cognitive control and other cognitive functions (e.g., attention, sensorimotor integration, decision-making)
