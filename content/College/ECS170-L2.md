### Outline
What is an agent?
What is a rational agent?
How to build a rational agent?

#### Agents
An **agent** is anything that can be viewed as perceiving its *environment* through *sensors* and acting upon that *environment* through *actuators*
- Sensors and Actuators are 2 important components to agents

Humans are agents!
- Sensors: eyes, ears, ...
- Actuators: hands, legs, ...

##### An Agent is a Function that Perceives and Acts
Percept: Perception inputs at a time
Percept Sequence: Vector P of perception history
Action set: A
Agent Function: f: P -> A
Agent Program: A program that implements an agent function
Architecture: the computing device with physical sensors and actuators that the program can run on
*Agent = architecture + **agent program** which implements the agent function*

#### Rational Agents
**Rational Agent** - An agent that does the right thing, meaning that the agent function is defined correctly in the table
- But how to define?
- *Performance Measure* - An objective criterion for success of an agent's action given the percept sequence
	- A performance measure for a vacuum-cleaner agent might include:
		- +1 for each clean of a square in time T
		- -1 point for each move to a different square because of electricity and noise

What is rational at any given time depends on four things:
- Agents prior knowledge of the environment
- Actions that the agent can perform
??

##### Design Process for a Rational (AI) Agent
1. Precondition: specify a task environment for the AI agent
2. Design: Construct a function f to maximize the EV of the performance measure
3. Implementation: Write and test an agent program that implements f on a particular architecture
	- Agent program: Map from percepts to actions
	- Architecture: Computing device with percepts and actuators

##### Specifying Agent Environment
*Task Environment*: Problem specs for which the agent is a solution
**PEAS** - How to specify the task environment
- *P*erformance measure
- *E*nvironment description
- *A*ctuators
- *S*ensors

##### PEAS of a Autonomous Taxi
*P:*
- Safe, short travel time, ...
*E:*
- Roads, traffic, ...
*A:*
- Steering, accelerator, ...
*S:*
- Cameras, sonar, speedometer, GPS


##### Seven Properties of Task Environments
1. States observability
2. Number of agents
3. Successor state determination (deterministic, non, stochastic)
4. Episodic or Sequential
5. Environment static or dynamic during decisions
6. State of the environment and action of the agent over time, discrete or continuous
7. Environment known or unknown to the agent
