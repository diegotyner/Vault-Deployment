> What interests you about the field of Neurotech? *
```
I've always been fascinated by how insights can be drawn from the brain, and by the study of intelligent systems (biological or otherwise). The opportunity to decode neural signals and use them to interact with technology is exactly the kind of work I want to be involved in.  
Additionally, it’s exciting to be part of cutting-edge research in this field. I'm confident that neurotech will continue to evolve and will one day become readily accessible technology.

> Why do you want to join the projects division and what do you hope to gain from joining?*
```
I want to join the projects division to gain a deeper understanding of neural signals and the insights we can draw from them. On top of that, joining the projects division would be a fantastic way to get a better understanding of neurotechnology and open myself up to a future in neuroengineering.
On the technical side, the range of skills involved is very exciting. I’m very intrigued by the idea of working closely with hardware like the Cyton board, as well as exploring the higher-level ML aspects.

I'm an experienced programmer, having developed my skills through coursework and personal projects. 
I've worked with pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlin, seaborn, and tensorflow.
I've applied these libraries in a sentiment analysis classifier I created for an AISC project and am currently using them for a song recommender project I'm working on. In addition to Python-based projects, I have also completed several web development projects.

```
Yes, I have experience in neuroscience, psychology, computer science, and machine learning. I've completed coursework in neuroscience, cognitive psychology, and computer science as well as worked on projects in machine learning and web development. 
I also worked as a research assistant at the Learning and Decision Making lab, where I gained experience in research methods and design, as well as fMRI neural imaging.

> Optional: What BCI projects do you want to work on?
```
I would be interested in working on a project that aims to predict if a participant will accept or reject a deal, possibly using a task like the ultimatum game, where subjects make decisions based on offers. While I'm aware that it would be difficult to decode these signals and it would likely be challenging to tell anything aside from whether a participant is thinking hard about a decision or not, I still think it could be a fun and challenging project.
