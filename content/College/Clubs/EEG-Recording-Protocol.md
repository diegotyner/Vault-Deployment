## 🎤 Vocab


## ❗ Information
Optimizing EEG recordings is tedious, as noise is so large compared to signal. Temperature of the room can be a [substantial effect](https://erpinfo.org/s/Kappenman-2010-Psychophys-Impedance-p398.pdf) even

Its probably best to use as a reference, it's ridiculous in its level of detail (they list the brand of plastic comb they use (and that they bought a six pack)).

### Big Takeaways
- Best not to leave wires dangling at odd angles, straight down best. 
- Try not to readjust electrodes after placing gel
- HEOG and VEOG electrodes (horizontal and vertical Electrooculography (EOG)) are used to track eye movements of the participant. 
- Want impedance under 50kΩ, can turn an impedance threshold to 75 to alert if anything goes wrong
	- "Always check the Ground first; if the impedance of the Ground is high, the rest of the electrodes will show high impedance"
> For experiments in which data quality is exceptionally important (e.g., ERP decoding experiments), reduce the impedances to <10 kΩ when possible without causing significant discomfort.

#### Tuning
Check bullet 11 of **Running the Subject**, provides a good rundown of some simple diagnostics
