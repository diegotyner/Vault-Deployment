### Aphantasia EEG Case Report
>  A well-established early ERP marker of face-sensitive cortical processing is the N170 event related potential component, before 200 msec in occipital and temporal areas. It may reflect the operation of a neural mechanism tuned to detect (as opposed to identify) human faces

		- Prime a color rivalry task (like the 3D movies with red/blue), and see which the aphantasic is more likely to answer. Not really EEG, but tests for aphantasia.
		- Combine it with contrasting components (maybe N170 for faces and something else?)
