# 📗 -> 11/3/22: Introduction to Neuroscience & EEG
[Lecture 2](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RDX82K90qK6Rg-O6Yh71HLykNv6SPA0Fu6IlfwZVfXY/edit#slide=id.g157b97297c0_0_0)
## 🎤 Vocab
**BCI** - Brain Computer Interfaces. Based on recording neural activity and outputting to an external machine output.


## ❗ Information


## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
[[Frontal-Lobe]] - Is responsible for high level executive functions
- Decision making
- Planning
- Goal Oriented Responses
- Emotion Regulation
- Impulse Control
### Motor Cortex
[[Motor-Cortex]]
- Present on both hemispheres
- Located in frontal lobe in precentral gyrus
- Responsible for voluntary muscle movement 
- Info travels through from premotor cortex (planning of movement) -> M1 -> spinal cord -> muscles contraction 
- Corticospinal tract: carries motor signals from the primary motor cortex in the brain, down the spinal cord, to the muscles of the trunk and limbs
- Corticobulbar tract conducts impulses from the brain to the cranial nerves






[[Parietal-Lobe]]
- Processes somatosensory information
- Integrates multiple sensory modalities together
### Somatosensory Cortex
[[Somatosensory-Cortex]]
- Present on both hemispheres
- Located in postcentral gyrus 
- Responsible for processing sensations including
	- Touch (fine touch, texture, vibration)
	- Proprioception : perception and awareness about the position and movement of your body
	- Nociception: detection of painful stimuli
	- Temperature 
- Info travels through receptors -> thalamus -> S1
- Somatotopic organization:  point-for-point correspondence of an area of the body to a specific point on the central nervous system. 
- More sensitive areas take up more space in the somatotopic arrangement


[[Occipital-Lobe]]
- Visual Processing
- Color and Motion
- Object Identification and location orientation

[[Temporal-Lobe]]
- Auditory Processing
- Language Processing


### EEG 101
Digital vs Analog
Time and Frequency Domains
Dry Electrodes: Signal metal that acts as a conductor between skin and the electrode (MUSE)
Wet Electrodes: Electrolyte gel acts as a conductor between skin and the electrode

Need to have ground and reference electrodes

EEG Collects:
- Neural Activity 
- Motor Movements
- Other Electrical Signals
Know:
- Noise
- SIgnal to Noise Ratio (SNR): Compares level of desired signal to level of background noise
- Artifacts: Signal not arising from the desired target. IE you can get artifacts from somebody moving, creating a signal not from the brain

### Brainwaves AKA Neural Oscillations:
[[Brainwaves]] are repeating rhythmic patterns of electrical activity in the CNS, also known as neural oscillations
Their main features are frequency and amplitude
- Higher frequency - the more awake
- Slow waves = high amplitude
- Mu waves (8-13 hz) -> from sensorimotor areas

Gamma (>35 Hz)
- Deep focus

Beta (13-35 Hz)
- Awake and active
- Frontal & Central regions

Alpha (8-13 Hz)
- Awake but relaxed
- Associated with Occipital region

Theta (4-8 Hz)
- Daydreaming, meditation

Delta (.5-4 Hz)
- Deep sleep, dreaming
- Right Hemisphere

### Sleep
During sleep, sleep spindles and k complexes are other patterns of brain waves that occur during NREM (Non Rapid Eye Movement)
- Sleep stage 1: alpha theta
- Sleep stage 2: theta & sleep spindles
- Sleep stage 3-4: Delta
