## ðŸ“‚ Project Logs 

*11/11/24* - This is the Monday after our first group meeting (Wednesday). It was great meeting the group, and we've jotted down a bunch of our ideas [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EeTEgMblejIQlQ0WO3AALCh4zImAOY4TKZnYtlBJJcg/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.zbqre1c3qojz). None of them seemed to really resonate, aside from the idea of doing a project around [[Aphantasia-Reading|aphantasia]]. I need to research this condition, and see what it actually means, and how we could do a project around it. I've already come up with this snippet, but it remains to be seen how feasible it is as an actual project, I would hate to ruin my groups chance to work with neurotech.
Continue before next meeting with the reading

*11/17/24* - This is the Sunday after our meeting, and we've pivoted our project. Now, we're looking to investigate witness testimony. How much can you trust a witness testimony, and how confident are you in what they say?
I'm going to be doing some research today. 

*11/18/24* - Monday after our 1:1. Had a good meeting, assigned work, set up the notion to our project (Kanban tasks and resources page), and decided on a research question with some strong ideas about design.
> How can you use BCI to enhance the trustworthiness of witness testimony?
