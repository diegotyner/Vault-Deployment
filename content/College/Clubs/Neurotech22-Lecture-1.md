# 📗 -> 10/27/22: Neurotech First Project Meeting
[Lecture 1](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ApocJmdvIaMrYFblFS6BZ_lc6M6NvVbY-UY3VxQQ8AY/edit?usp=sharing)
## 🎤 Vocab
**EEG** - Electroencephalogram
**MEG** - Magnetoencephalography
**fMRI** - Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
**PET** - Positron Emission Tomography
**fNIRS** - Measures blood oxygenation in the brain, similar to fMRI.
	- Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy
	
**ECoG** - Electrocorticography
	- Intracranial EEG basically (IEEG)

## ❗ Information
Small summary

## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
Gain experience with hardware (Muse, OpenBCI)

### Neurotech:
- Device that interfaces with the Central Nervous systems
- Includes imaging and stimulating CNS  

Neurotech includes:
- Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs)
- Neuroimaging
- Neuroprosthetics
- Neurostimulation (Deep Brain Stimulation)

### Uses:
- Recreational
- Cognitive Enhancement
- Rehabilitation
- Restoring Function
Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS), Neuroprosthetics, Neuralink, Cochlear Implants


### Brain Computer Interface (BCI):
- Acquires brain signals, analyzes them, and translates them into commands that are relayed to an output device to carry out a desired action

Applications of BCI:
- Communication
- Movement
	- Prosthetics
	- Locomotion
- Neurorehabilitation
- Recreational

### How does it work:
Signal Acquisition -> Signal Processing -> Device Interface -> Assistive Device -> (feedback) -> Mental Task

Restart Process, it’s a loop
1. Signal Acquisition
	- Noninvasive:
		- EEG
			- Electroencephalogram
		- MEG
			- Magnetoencephalography
		- fMRI
			- Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
		- PET
			- Positron Emission Tomography
		- fNIRS  
			- Measures blood oxygenation in the brain, similar to fMRI.
			- Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy

	- Invasive
		- ECoG
			- Electrocorticography
			- Intracranial EEG basically
		- Implanted Electrodes, arrays

Factors to Consider:
- Invasiveness
- Signal Accuracy
- Spatial Resolution
- Temporal Resolution
- Cost

Electroencephalogram (EEG):
- Measure of electrical activity in the brain
- Picks up activity frm groups of neuron
- On-scalp electrodes
