### Course Intro:
Building models is essential to science, whether models are conceptual, mathematical, computational, or physical
- Building models, for most of you, is something you have never done before
- This course is about building a specific kind of scientific model:
- Agent-base models,
- Building them,
- Analyzing them with computer simulations,
- Interpreting their results and
- Presenting our findings

**Agents:**
- Behave
- Can interact with each other
- Can interact with their environment
- Could be:
	- people making decisions about who to date or vampire bats deciding whether to share a blood meal with a starving bat
**Environment:**
- Introduces conditions
- Defines boundaries
- Specifies competitive or cooperative situations in which agents behave 
- Could be:
	-  the representation of physical space, or a network)
**Interaction:**
- Agents interact with each other and their environment via defined mechanisms, which can be
	- direct (agent-agent) and
	- indirect (agent-environment)

### Example of Vampire Bat behavior
They have very interesting social behavior:
- Social Levels of Analysis: Populations, Social groups, social networks, and roost
- Behavior: Food sharing, foraging, reproduction
