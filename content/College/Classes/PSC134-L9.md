## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
### Pruning
Sensory areas mature first, then “higher level” areas; PFC last of all

### Complexity of the brain
> If you want to understand how something works, take it apart, then try to put it back together

We can't put something back together with billions of neurons. How can we change the question?
- Add neuro + behavioral constraints



## 🧪-> Example
### Learning Questions
> What brain areas do you know are mapped onto certain functions
```
Occipital Lobe -> Vision
Fusiform face area -> Very involved in recognizing faces
Frontal Lobe -> Higher order thinking
Somatosensory cortex -> Sensations of touch and pain on the body
Motor cortex -> Sending motor signals to the body
```

> How does the X (brain region/process) support Y function?
```
Things like the somatosensory and motor cortex are well adapted for supporting their respective functions because of their topographic mapping, that helps to organize our ability to perceive and act on input. 
Other areas like the occipital lobe and frontal lobe seem to arbitrarily support their function, only relying on the fact that they receive consistent input relating to their functions, process it internally, and output a decision to brain areas responsible with further executing their function.  
```

> What Ys (functions) are you most interested in?
```
I'm most interesting with decision making, and analyzing the internal mechanisms that the brain uses to create its decision.
