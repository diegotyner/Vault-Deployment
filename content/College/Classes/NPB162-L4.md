Small summary




## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
**Active sensory systems** are sensory receptors that are activated by probing the environment with self- generated energy.
- Used by bats, dolphins, whales, oilbirds, cave swiftlet, shrew, catfish

Bats produce **echolocation** by emitting high frequency sound pulses through their mouth or nose and listening to the echo.

#### Soundwaves
*Speed of sound (v)*: 343 m/sec in air (~1500 m/s)
*Sound Frequency (f)*:
- number of times per second that a sound pressure wave repeats itself. 
- units are Hz (cycles / sec)
- number of waves that pass a point per unit time
*Wavelength ($\lambda$)*: The distance between adjacent identical parts of a wave (in time = Period) 
$v = f \cdot \lambda$

- Because bat sounds are much higher frequency than humans (80 kHz > 100 Hz), this allows them to detect much smaller objects (1-2mm compared to ~1m)
