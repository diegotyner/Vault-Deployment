## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
### Video GAN
In relevant situations, we don't just want to deepfake random images. We want to condition our model on existing images, to 'extend' existing pictures/videos.
- Also a very difficult question. What should the model move? We as people now that the laws of physics apply, and that certain things do and don't move (trains vs train tracks), but the model does not. 

GAN has a latent space:
- The GAN serves as a transformation from noise to image
- Interestingly: you can do vector addition of noise inputs to get fun results

- Manipulating the *noise* that creates these images, not the images themselves
- Ties to [[Explainable-AI]], and similar work being done on [[LLM|LLMs]]. 
- For actual applications, you can imagine wanting to translate an image from daytime to night-time
	- *Image to Image Translation*

- Looks intersting (creating a city view from satelite view but I don't understand)

#### Other interesting things with GAN
- Text-to-Image Translation (text2image)

- Generate New Human Poses
- Photos to Emojis
- Photograph Editing (+- bangs, smiling, etc)
- Image De-raining
- Photo Inpainting
- Face Image Inpainting
- Clothing Translation
