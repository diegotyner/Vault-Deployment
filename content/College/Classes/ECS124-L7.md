## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
#### Last time
- Covered BLAST
	- 2 main events in blast:
	1) Preprocessing set of functions/events. Does 2 main things.
		1) Creates HSP = Highly related 3 characters strings
		   HSP( {ATT} ) -> ATA, ATC, CTA 
		   ATT -> ATA, ATC, CTA. For all 3 possible characters?
		2) All known sequences, breaks them into substrings of length 3, AND stores in a different table where that string length 3 is present. 
		   S1 = CTATATAT
			   Would get grouped into the following 3 sequences:
			   CTA, TAT, ATA, TAT, ...
		   S100 = ---x200--- ATA
		   
| ATA | `[s1, 3], [s1, 5], [s100, 201]` |
| --- | ------------------------------- |
|     |                                 |
	2) Running BLAST
		1) Takes sequences and breaks it into unique k-mers of size 3
		   GAATTATT
		   GAA, AAT, ATT, TTA, TAT
			   - Only include unique ones, not the second ATT


Store a table of all possible 3 chars:


Blossom 62 (or 82?) - 
- Our goal is to find sequences that max our query in thousands of sequences


20 possible protein sequences:


#### Optimality
`OPT(i,j)` = Max similarity/alignment score for sequence `x[1...i]` and `y[1..j]`
- x = "happydayare"
- y = "ppydayaretoday"
- `OPT(5,3)`: Max align between x="happy" and y="ppy"
- `OPT(i,j)` = `max(a,b,c)`
	- Where a=matching characters, b and c are space

spaces and mismatches cost zero, matches+1
```
score(i,j) defined as: 
	if (x[i]==y[j]) Return 1
	else Return 0
```


What does the following statement describe, assuming its the optimal alignment?
`OPT(i-3,j) + space(3)`
> Optimal similarity score for x(1...i) and y(1...j) is created by:
- |  x(1...i-3) | i-2 | i-1 |  i  |
- |  y(1...j)    |   -  |   -  |  -  |
Essentially saying the optimal alignment is matching up the last 3 letters of x (i-2, i-1, i) with spaces/gaps

---

$x_i = 1$ if $s[i]$ matches something in s2
else $x_i=0$

The probability that we match something: 1/4
$E[x_i] = 1\cdot (1/4) + 0 \cdot (3/4) = 1/4$
$\sum^n _{i=1} E[x_i] = \sum^n _{i=1} 1/4 = n/4$
