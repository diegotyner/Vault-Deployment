## ❗ Unit and Larger Context
Viola Johns Face Detector - Given an image, it finds the location of the face
- Cheap to run, very common on phones




## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
Fourier Transform is used?

Sampling and the Nyquist rate
 • **Aliasing** can arise when you sample a continuous signal or image
 - occurs when your sampling rate is not high enough to capture the amount of detail in your image
- Can give you the wrong signal/image—an alias
- formally, the image contains structure at different scales
	 - called “frequencies” in the Fourier domain
 - the sampling rate must be high enough to capture the highest frequency in the image
 • To avoid aliasing:
 - sampling rate ≥ 2 * max frequency in the image
	 - said another way: ≥ two samples per cycle
 - This minimum sampling rate is called the Nyquist rate

Blurring a camera (physically, out of focus or fogging up glasses) can be used as a form of anti-aliasing, as it will reduce the high frequency signals
