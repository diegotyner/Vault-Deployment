# 📗 -> 10/31: Neural Networks
---

## 🎤 Vocab
**NAS** - Neural Architecture Search:
- A technique for automating the design of neural networks
- Like optimizing layers and neurons

## ❗ Unit and Larger Context
Lecture was the tensorflow playground with explanation of layers, neurons, and learning

Then neural network slides?

## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
### Neural Networks for images
An image is convolved onto a convolution layer, then forms an output
Image --(weight mask)-> Feature Map


## 🧪-> Example
- List examples of where entry contents can fit in a larger context

## 🔗 -> Links
### Resources
- Put useful links here

### Connections
- Link all related words
