# 📗 -> 9/26/24: Course Introduction
---
### When lectures is over, add the content as aliases above
[Lecture Slide Link]

## 🎤 Vocab
**Sample Space:** Denoted $S$, is a set of all possible outcomes of an experiment
- Sample space of rolling a dice: $S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$
**Finite Sample Space:** A finite amount of results can occur. 
- Dice rolls
- Coin flips
- A grades in a class
**Infinitely Countable:** Mappable onto the natural numbers
- Number of trials until an uncertain outcome is reached (
	- Rolling dice until 6 comes up
**Infinite Non-Countable:** Mappable onto the real numbers
- Exact distance (can be irrational for instance)
- Location, speed, time, weight
**Event:** A subset of the sample space
If $S$ is number rolled:
- Rolling a 2 is an event
- Rolling an even number is an event
- Rolling a number 1-6 (the entire set) is an event

 
## ❗ Unit and Larger Context
A general introduction to the role of probability and statistical inference
### Course Content:
- Combinatorics and general probability
- Confidence Intervals
- Hypothesis Testing
- Markov Chains
- Maybe more ML stuff

- Will NOT be covering deterministic events, only covering events with uncertainty


## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
- There is no right or wrong sample space
- Flipping 2 coins can have multiple valid sample spaces
	- $S = \{HH, HT, TH, TT\}$ where S is the ordering of rolls
	- $S = \{0, 1, 2\}$, where S is the # of heads
- Can have finite, countably infinite, and uncountably infinite sample spaces as well


## 🧪-> Example
- List examples of where entry contents can fit in a larger context
