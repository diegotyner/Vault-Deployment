Biological Trees





> Given a distance matrix, is it additive?
> How to get the distance matrix? Distance between human and mouse?
- You can additive tree $\approx$ nearest neighbor (proved 1987)

Four point test for additive matrix 

![[ECS124-L14 2025-03-04 18.33.05.excalidraw]]
$D_{i,j} + D_{k,l} \leq D_{i,k} + D_{j,l} = D_{i,l} + D_{j,k}$

- Check that the latter value are equal to each other, and that the leq statement holds true. If that is true, then the matrix is additive
Pair top with bottom
- P1: $x_1 + x_3 + x_4 = x_1 + x_3 + x_5$
- P2: $x_1 + x_3 + x_5 = x_1 + x_3 + x_4$


D(A,B)    D(B,C)
D(A,B)    D(B,D)
D(A,D)    D(C,D)

|     | A(j) | B(l) | C(i) | D(k) |
| --- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| A   |      | 18   | 3    | 17   |

$D_{i,j} + D_{k,l} = max( D_{i,k} + D_{j,l}, D_{i,l} + D_{j,k} )$


### Molecular Clock Theory
1) Mutations are rare, AND occur at the same rate
2) Single origin

Time zero is the time of mutation.
Ultrametric tree: Distance/height is time
- Can be created using UPGMA algo
Also, even if data not ultrametric => Create ultrametric tree

Distance matrix is ultrametric? 3-pt test
- $D(B,A) < D(A,C) = D(B,C)$
- In a set of three, one is smaller and the other two are the same if the data is ultrametric


#### Jukes Cantor Distance Matrix
All distance matrix come from alignment
**JC69** - Markov chain model for DNA sequences
- The state of an event only depends on the state immediately preceding it (t-1 / prev)



|     | A                    | T                    | C                    | G                    |
| --- | -------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| A   | $1-3\alpha \Delta t$ | $\alpha \Delta t$    | $\alpha \Delta t$    | $\alpha \Delta t$    |
| T   | $\alpha \Delta t$    | $1-3\alpha \Delta t$ | $\alpha \Delta t$    | $\alpha \Delta t$    |
| C   | $\alpha \Delta t$    | $\alpha \Delta t$    | $1-3\alpha \Delta t$ | $\alpha \Delta t$    |
| G   | $\alpha \Delta t$    | $\alpha \Delta t$    | $\alpha \Delta t$    | $1-3\alpha \Delta t$ |
$(\alpha \Delta t)^2$ - Prob of mutation
- Tends to be small
$(1-3\alpha \Delta t)^2$ - No Mutation

$q_{t+\Delta t}=q_t(1-3\alpha \Delta t)^2 + 3(\alpha \Delta t)^2)$

$q_{t+\Delta t}=q_t(1-6\alpha \Delta t)^2 + 2(\alpha \Delta t)(1-q_t)$
$\int \frac{q_{t+\Delta t} - q_t}{\Delta t} = \int q_t + 2\alpha$

*Distance Between Two Sequences*
$djc = -\frac{3}{4}ln(1-\frac{4}{3}pt)$
- percentage dif

s1 = ATCCATCG
s2 = ATTCATGG
pt = 2/8
- 6 matches, 2 different, out of six

$M[s1,s1] = -\frac{3}{4}ln(1-\frac{4}{3}pt) = (-3/4) ln(6/8) = 0.364$
