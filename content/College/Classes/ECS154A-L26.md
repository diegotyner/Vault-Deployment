FF overhead terms:
- *Propagation time*: Time it takes when you give it the clock for the thing to come out
- *Setup time:* The amount of time required for the input to a Flip-Flop to be stable before a clock edge

**Pipeline overhead:**
- A transfer from pipeline stage to pipeline stage
- A function of the hardware you're using.
- They limit how much you can pipeline because they add extra time each step you add

**Balanced pipeline:**
- Worst case paths have to be approximately equal
- When balancing a pipeline, usually a better bet to try and combine steps than to split
	- Not always, no hard and fast rule, but generally

**Bypass/Forwarding**
- Having external hardware detect that a value will be needed, and directly passing the value
- However, some instructions have data later (like lw), and even forwarding needs bubbles

You can do a NOP by:
- Deny the ability to write until its in the correct stage. Then, its like nothing happened.

### Basic Block:
- Sequence of instructions with a single entry and a single exit
- Cannot schedule code mixing between basic blocks.
- These are the unit used to execute code scheduling a lot of the time, move instructions around within a basic block.
