### Pipelining
$CPU_{time} = \frac{cycles}{insts}\cdot \frac{insts}{prog} \cdot \frac{time}{cycle}$

Doing laundry example:
- Wash = 40
- Dry = 50
- Fold = 30
6 => 330m

WDF
-WDF
--WDF
---WDF
....

You have to wait for the longest thing to occur. So in this example, we have to wait 50 minutes in each pipeline cycle, even though folding finishes in 30.

*Balanced pipeline*:
- WCP (longest stage) is approximately equal for all
In the above situation its not balanced 40|50|30 is not equal for all.
Instead, find ways to balance the work. 
- He suggests taking the clothes out at 40 minutes and drying them with a hairdryer for 10 minutes so we have a 40|40|40 pipeline afterward. Cheeky.
- Now after balancing, we go from 300 -> 240 minutes.

#### FDE in computer:
FDE M W?
- Chat GPT said:
	- M (Memory access): This stage involves reading from or writing to memory.
	- W (Write-back): This stage writes the result back to a register.

Hazards:
- Structural - Resource conflict
- Data - 3 types
- Control - change in control flow

*Structural* - Problems come from shared resources
- Can often be fixed by spending more money
- IE, adding another memory (data memory and instruction memory to speed up cycle time)

`ADD R1, R2, R3`
`SUB R1, R2, R3`

`123456`
`FDEMW`
`-FDEMW`
How can we write R1? 
- It happens in cycle 5: Write
- It gets read in 2: Decode
	- The 2 that gets read is a *RAW hazard*
If we read after writing (say a register when adding), we get a *read after write hazard* (RAW hazard)

Note: D=Decode + Read Regs
- Write on 1st half
- Read on 2nd half

How to avoid:
- Forwarding
- Bypassing

In more complex pipelines where you can do your own instructions, you also have to worry about *write after write hazards* (WAW hazzard)
