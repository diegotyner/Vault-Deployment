### Geometric Parameter
Probability p of a success
Keep going until there is a success
p - Win
(1-p) - Lose

Winning for the first time on the 4th try:
- Actually just lose-lose-lose-win
	- (1-p)^3 (p)

**PMF** - Probability Mass Function. 
- $P_X(t) = P(X=t)$
- $P_X(0) = P(p)$

#### a)
> What is the pro that it takes 4 transmissions to receive the message?
p=0.2

$Var[X] = \frac{1-p}{p^2}$
$E[X] = \frac{1}{p}$
$P_X(4)=0.8^3 \cdot 0.2^1$

#### Indicator
x={0,1}
$E[X]=p$
$Var[X]=p(1-p)$
> different from geometric, since an indicator is a one trial thing. Geometric could theoretically go on forever


#### Binomial
Play n games and win k times
General PMF:
- $P_X(k)={n \choose k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}$
$E[X] = np$
$Var[X] = np(1-p)$

Proof by seperating expectation of each trial out
$E[X] = E[x_1+x_2+\dots+x_n]=E[x_1]+\dots+E[x_n] = n(p)$
^ n trials, each having a probability p of occurring


> Have 5 tries, how likely to win twice? p=0.3

You can win in multiple different orders 
${5 \choose 2}(.3)^2(.7)^3$

A common question will be probability of winning or losing more than a certain value. Use set compliment rules to facilitate this:
> Probability that I win two or more times, out of 45 games with probability p?

$1-P(X=1)-P(x=0) = 1-{45 \choose 1}p^1(1-p)^{44} - {45 \choose 0}p^0(1-p)^{45}$


#### Uniform:
Every int is equally likely from $[a,b]$
$E[X]=\frac{1+b}{2}$
$Var[X]=\frac{(b-a)(b-a+2)}{12}$
