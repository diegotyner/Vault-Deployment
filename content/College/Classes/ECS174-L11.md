# 📗 -> 11/1: Neural Network Functions
---
[Lecture Slide Link]

## 🎤 Vocab
**Max Pool** - Selecting the biggest value in a neighborhood as a representative to reduce output
- *Pooling* together and picking the max
- Average pooling also popular

**One Hot Encoding** - [[One-Hot-Encoding]], we want the output layer to in a perfect world only have 1 active (output layer is only cat firing, dog and squirrel inactive). This is a form of one hot encoding

**Soft max** - An activation function (like sigmoid or RELU)
## $P(c_i|x)=y_i = \frac{exp(x_i)}{\sum ^n _{j=1}exp(x_j)}$

**Multi Object Optimization** - More advanced? Optimizing more than one object


## ❗ Unit and Larger Context
Conv Nets
Convolution -> Pooling -> Convolution -> Pooling -> Fully connected -> Fully Connected -> Output Predictions

## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
RELU makes things non negative
Loss: Comparing ground truth with the output: $L(x,y,w) = \sum^n _{i=1} -gt(i)log(P(c_i|x))$
If we're assuming one hit encoding, we can make the following step:
Loss assuming one-hot encoding for ground truth: $L(x,y,w) = -log(P(c_y|x))$
Loss for a mini-batch of size N: $L=\sum^N_{k=1} -log(P(c_{y_k} |x_k))$

AlexNet presented at NIPS 2012, one of the biggest strides for CNNs, neural networks period. They showed that just expanding hte number of filters, layers, datas (and having access to a GPU) helped the network to scale very well
