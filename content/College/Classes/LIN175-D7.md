Wernicke-Lictheim Geschwind Model


Arcuate Fasciculus - Tract of white matter that connect Broca's and Wernicke's Area
- Damage leads to difficulty repeating words

Broca's Aphasia - Unable to produce fluent speech
Wernicke's Aphasia - Meaningless speech, a fluent aphasia
**Conduction Aphasia** - Inability to repeat word, due to a psychological problem
 **Apraxia** - Unable to physically produce speech

TMS - Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation

EEG - Electroencephalography
EMG - Electromyography, used for muscles
MEG vs EMG:
- Magnetoencephalography (MEG) - Uses magnetic fields
- Electromyography (EMG) - Electrical activity

PET - Positron Emission Tomography
PET was the fMRI of the past, now most people opt for fMRI. Better spatial and temporal resolution. 


ERP Components:
- P300 - Surprise
- N400 - Semantic Unexpected Word
- P600 - Syntactic Anomalies
- MMN (Mismatch Negativity)
