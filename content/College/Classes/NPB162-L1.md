## 🎤 Vocab
**Ethology**: The biological discipline that studies natural animal behavior in a broad range of organisms by using objective and comparative approaches. 
**Neuroethology**: The biological discipline that attempts to understand how the nervous system controls the natural behavior of animals


## ❗ Unit and Larger Context
Lecture 1 Outline
1. Tinbergen’s four questions
   
2. What is Neuroethology?
	1. Choosing a simple model system
	2. Ethogram: The entire behavioral repertoire of an animal species
3. Innate behavior vs Learned behavior
	1. Fixed Action Pattern (FAP)
	2. Learned behavior



## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
### Tinbergen's Four Questions
A framework for analyzing behavior

1. Function (or adaption): Why is the animal performing the behavior?  
2. Evolution (or phylogeny): How did the behavior evolve?  
3. Causation (or mechanism): What causes the behavior to be performed?  
4. Development (or ontogeny): How has the behavior developed during the lifetime of the individual?  
> Questions 1 and 2 give **ultimate or evolutionary explanations**. These are answers that take a longer perspective and try to explain why the behaviour has evolved. 
> On the other hand, questions 3 and 4 give **proximate explanations**. These are answers that look into the immediate mechanical reasons for why a behavior is expressed.

*Cichlid* behavior is an example of a well studied species with highly developed behaviors.

**Krogh’s Principle:** 
- “For a large number of problems there will be some animal of choice or a few such animals in which it can. Be most conveniently studied”

##### Possible exam question:
What makes an animal ideal for study?
- Inexpensive
- Suitable for lab study
- Easy to maintain
- Easy to breed
- Lots of kids
and other relevant behaviors! (lifespan, simplicity)


### **Innate Behavior**
Unlearned behavior. Instinctive.
- reflexes
- taxis  
- kinesis  
- fixed action patterns  
- circadian rhythms
- ...

**Fixed Action Patterns (FAP)** 
- complex behavior with a lot of steps
- continues despite interruption
- Innate
*Example* - Egg rolling behavior in a chicken. It will attempt to bring egg to nest, but if egg taken they will continue rolling the 'egg'
> Once triggered, you cannot stop them.


**Sign Stimulus** - Triggers the FAP. 
- Presenting egg to chicken
- **Releasing Value** - Property of stimuli of how strong/reliable it is in inducing the FAP
**Innate Releasing mechanism** - Hardwired neural network in the brain, that triggers a particular response


*Applications*: You can measure the releasing value of an egg, by how reliably it triggers FAP.
- Greener egg > Browner egg
- Larger egg > Smaller egg


### **Learned Behavior**
Behavior developed through experience
- Imprinting 
- Habituation
- Sensitization
- Classical Conditioning
- Operant Conditioning
- ...

Konrad Lorenz, Niko Tinbergen and Karl Von Frisch shared the Nobel Price in 1973 (1886 - 1982)
- “Discoveries in individual and social behavior patterns"

##### Classical Conditioning:
Learned association
- *US*: Unconditioned Stimulus  
- *UR*: Unconditioned Response  
- *CS*: Conditioned Stimulus  
- *CR*: Conditioned Response

##### Operant Conditioning / Procedural Learning
- Positive Reinforcement
- Positive Punishment
