## üé§ Vocabulary

- **Memory System**: The organization and architecture of memory in computing, including volatile and non-volatile types.
- **Volatile Memory**: Memory that loses its data when power is turned off (e.g., RAM).
- **Non-Volatile Memory**: Memory that retains data without power (e.g., Flash memory).
- **Static RAM (SRAM)**: Fast and expensive memory using flip-flops.
- **Dynamic RAM (DRAM)**: Slower, inexpensive memory using capacitors.
- **Cache Memory**: A small, fast memory located between the CPU and main memory to speed up access times.
- **Associative Memory**: Memory that allows data to be accessed based on content rather than address.
- **Replacement Schemes**: Algorithms for deciding which cache entry to replace (e.g., LRU, FIFO).

## ‚ùó Context and Significance

- **Purpose**: To understand the design and function of memory systems, focusing on how cache memory can enhance performance by mitigating the slower speeds of DRAM.
- **Importance**: Memory systems are crucial in computer architecture, affecting performance, cost, and power consumption.
- **Broader Ideas**: Links to processor design, memory hierarchy, and performance optimization strategies.

## ‚úíÔ∏è Scratch Notes

### Key Definitions and Notes
- **Memory** as a linear array: Addressed from 0 to N, each cell holding bits.
- **Example**: 8-entry, 16-bit memory = 8 x 2 bytes = 16 total bytes.
- **Decoders**: Used to enable specific lines in memory (e.g., 3-to-8 decoder).

| Feature          | Static RAM       | Dynamic RAM      |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Speed            | Fast             | Slow             |
| Heat             | Hot              | Cool             |
| Size             | Large            | Dense            |
| Cost             | Expensive        | Cheap            |

### Key Processes or Frameworks
- **Cache Operation**:
  1. CPU sends a memory address.
  2. Cache checks for the address.
  3. On hit, data is returned quickly.
  4. On miss, data is fetched from main memory.
  5. Replacement policy decides which data to replace.

## üß† Critical Insights

- **Memory Hierarchy**: Understanding the trade-offs between speed, size, and cost.
- **Dynamic vs. Static Memory**: The choice depends on application needs‚Äîstatic for speed, dynamic for density.
- **Cache Design**: Effective caching relies on understanding program locality (spatial and temporal).
