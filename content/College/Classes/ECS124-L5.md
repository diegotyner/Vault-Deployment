## ❗ Unit and Larger Context
### Alignment
Global:
$OPT(i,j) =$ max alignment score for sequences
- $s1[1...i]$ and $s1[1...j]$
$$
\displaylines{
= max[score(i,j) + OPT(i-1, j-1),\\ 
score(i, \_) + OPT(i-1, j), \\
score(\_, j) + OPT(i, j-1)]
}
$$
- Effectively, max of matching characters or a space/gap

Local:
$OPT(i,j) = max[0, a, b, c]$
- Where a, b, c are:
	- a - matching characters
	- b - gap, match i to space
	- c - gap, match j to space
- Notice how min is zero
