### When did you begin to like or dislike psychology, neuroscience, computer science, and/or math?
```
Psychology - I initially got into cognitive science because of my psychology coursework, but as I learn more I'm not satisfied with the psychologist level of analysis. It's interesting and necessary work, I just like the cognitive science approach more.

Neuroscience - I first started my coursework in this spring quarter, and it has been a bit intimidating. I can feel it growing on me though, especially as I learn more about system dynamics.

Computer Science - Freshman year, took my lower div classes in it and really liked it, so I added a double major in it. Very big fan of it.

Math - I learn it as it's necessary, I'm very neutral on it.

### What do you hope to get out of this course?
```
I hope to learn about drawing insights from the brain. Computational cognitive neuroscience is one of the areas of study I find most interesting, and I love learning about how intelligence arises/functions.
