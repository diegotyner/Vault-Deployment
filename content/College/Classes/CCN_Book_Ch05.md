**Neocortex** - 

## ❗ Information

Figure 5.1

### Subcortical Brain Areas
- [[Hippocampus]] - Plays a critical role in learning new everyday memories about events and facts
- [[Amygdala]] - Important for recognizing emotionally salient stimuli and alerting the rest of the brain about them
	- Important role in *motor control and reinforcement learning*
- [[Cerebellum]] - Plays a important role in motor coordination, contains 1/2 the neurons of the brain
- [[Thalamus]] - Provides the primary pathway for sensory information on its way to the neocrtex
	- Likely important for attention, arousal, and other modulatory functions
- [[Basal-Ganglia|Basal Ganglia]] - Helps to make the final "Go" call on whether (or not) to execute particular actions that the cortex "proposes"
	- Motor Control and RL
	- Executive Function

Details the functions and regions in each lobe

Different places in the brain signal in different ways

- Neocortex (parietal to frontal) 
> Does high-level metrical processing of sensory information, integrating multiple modalities and translating between different reference frames as necessary, to arrive at a range of possible responses to the current sensory environment


Study the 
- what vs where (ventral vs dorsal) in visual processing
- what vs how flow in the brain for information towards the prefrontal cortex
PFC and BG interact to produce a working memory system

```
I found it very understandable, but a bit too information rich. My experience with learning about the brain is that I only understand specific regions after diving more into the roles they play, like only placing the MTL after learning about memory. In general though, it was a very useful refresher, and I'll be revisiting the chapter in the future.

> Did a specific aspect of the reading raise questions for you or relate to other ideas and findings you’ve encountered, or are there other related issues you wish had been covered?)
```
I'm most excited to learn about the dopamine signaling pathways and feedback in the brain. I've always been excited by decisionmaking, and I haven't yet studied reinforcement learning, so I'm anticipating finally getting to cover that in my studies.
