## 🎤 Vocab
**Convolution** - The averaging of a pixel with the pixels surrounding it. A graphic of the process is shown below
- Results in a 'smoothing' effect
> Convolution is a more general and powerful technique that uses a kernel (a small matrix) to scan an image, element-wise multiplying each pixel value with the corresponding kernel element

## ❗ Unit and Larger Context

## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes

A pixel in 2D space mapping to a brightness:
$$
\displaylines{
P = f(x,y) \\
f: R^2 \rightarrow R
}
$$

### Image operations:
- Map an image onto a greyscale version of the image: 
- Transform the image, maybe remove the background
- Turn the image into a vector of values (maybe a float representing brightness)
- Compare similarity of two images

### Getting Rid of Noise:
**Convolution** is very helpful. This is an example of a box filter. Multiplying by a matrix with an 'eye' (3x3 where all values are zero except for (2,2)=1) outputs the same image.

## Different types of filters:
### Smoothing:
A box filter similar to above. 

### Sharpening:
Multiply with a matrix with a eye greater than 1. Increasing all values.


### Edge Detection:
A Sobel kernel, accentuates edges
Horizontal kernel: `[-1 0 1; -2 0 2; -1 0 1]`
Vertical kernel: `[-1 -2 -1; 0 0 0; 1 2 1]`

### Gradient Filter:
Horizontal Gradient: `[-1, 0, 1]`
Vertical Gradient: `[-1; 0; 1]`


### Gaussian:
You can convolve an image with a Gaussian matrix, where the center is more heavily weighted than outsides, according to the Gaussian equation
## $$G_{\sigma}(x,y) = \frac{1}{Z} e^{-\frac{x^2 + y^2}{2\sigma^2}}$$
- Gaussian filters are softer than box filters. Box filters often create artifacts. 
- Variance of the Gaussian determines the extent of smoothing.
- Parameter $\sigma$ is the “scale” / “width” / “spread” of the Gaussian kernel, and controls the amount of smoothing.
- Z is normalizing to 1, making it so that the area under the curve sums to 1

### Combining Filters:
Filters are associative
$$
\displaylines{
f * g * g^{\prime{}} = f * h \\
f * (g * h) = (f * g) * h \\
f * g = g * f
}
$$

This can be particularly useful in a Gaussian blur, where the horizontal and vertical blurs combine to give a 2D Gaussian blur, while being a much faster operation
#### The Gaussian is separable
$G_\sigma = G_\sigma ^x * G_\sigma ^y$
Left operation is much slower than right, while being equivalent


> [!NOTE] Not all filter are separable
