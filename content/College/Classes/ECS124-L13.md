## 🎤 Vocab



## ❗ Unit and Larger Context
Clustering

### Covered
Tree Creation
Tree & Kmeans


### Tree Clustering
UPGMA - Page 28 on PDF above
1) Form n clusters each w/ a single element
2) Construct graph T by assigning node for each cluster
3) Set height of each node to h(v)=0
	1) Should have constructed a symmetric/triangular matrix
4) while (more than 1 cluster)
```
	find 2 closest clusters c1, c2 # track the min in graph
	# The above is O(n^2)
	cluster C merges c1 and c2
	# |C| = |C1| + |C2|
	for every C^o != C:
```
- `O(n^2) book =>`  $\frac{1}{|C||C^o|} \sum_{i \in C} \sum_{j \in C^o} D(i,j)$
- `O(1)  class =>` $\frac{D[C_1, C^o] + D[C_2, C^o]}{2}$
5) Add new node C to the tree
	1) h(c) = D(C1, C2)/2
6) Assigning label h(c) - h(c1) to edge (c, c1)
7) Assigning label h(c) - h(c2) to edge (c, c2)
After this, we have a new "parent" node clustering the two elements, with height/edge weight constructed from distance to children


### Neighbor Joining
NOT COMPREHENSIVE
Page 29 for full algo
1) Form n clusters each w\ a single element
2) Construct graph T by assigning node for each element/cluster
3) while (there is more than one cluster)
	1) Find 2 closest clusters c1, c2 not based on distance, but based on D(c1, c2) - u(c1) - u(c2)
		1) *D(c1, c2) != D(c1, c2) - u(c1) - u(c2)*
		2) Taking away distance between mice and everybody else, then taking away distance between people and everybody else
		3) General idea: Account for the possibility that they are on a completely different branch from everybody else
	2) n^2- computer all u(c) for all clusters
	3) n^2 - compare all c1, c2: D(c1, c2) - u(c1) - u(c2)
4) Merge c1, c2 into single cluster 
5) Compute D: $\frac{D[C_1, C^o] + D[C_2, C^o]}{2}$
6) Add new vertex C
7) Assign length `h(C) = 1/2 * ( D(c1, c2) - u(c1) - u(c2) )` to edges (c, c1) and (c, c2)

| M   |     |     | 3   | 11  | 7   |
| R   |     |     |     | 12  | 10  |
| D   |     |     |     |     | 3   |
| C   |     |     |     |     |     |


|      | H   | M   | R   | D   | C   |
| ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| H    |     |     |     |     |     |
| u(h) |     |     |     |     |     |
$u(c) = \frac{1}{n-2}\sum_{|C'|}D(C, C')$
##### Work for the above:
- 4 - U(H) - U(M) = -6 - 4 
- 4 - U(H) - U(R) = 0 - 4
- 4 - U(H) - U(D) = -10 - 12 -4
- 4 - U(H) - U(C) = -11 - 12 - 4
