## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
*Propositional Logic*: a simple logic language used to describe a world, using sentences that follow a particular syntax
- Sentence - A expression assessable for Truth Value
- Atomic Sentence - True | False | P | Q | R | ...
- Complex Sentence - A combination of sentences bound together with logic operators
	- $\lnot, \land, \lor, \implies, \iff$
"There is no pit in (1,1)" : $R_1: \lnot P_{1,1}$

*Knowledge Base*: a set of sentences (declarations) in a formal language, e.g., propositional logic
- Used to create deductions
	- we know that there is not pit
	- we know that the square is breezy if and only if there is a pit in a neighboring square
	- ...

*Model*: a truth assignment function that maps each propositional symbol to either True or False
- A sentence could be true or false in a model, depending on the truth assignments. It can be true in some models, true in all models, or false in all models
- A model is a model of the KB if it satisfies every sentence in the KB, or all the sentences in the KB are true

Both Logic and Natural Language aim to express information
*Logical Formalism* - A language to express truth-conditional meaning
- More rigorous than natural language
- Can characterize reasoning (inference) of various forms

##### Pros of Propositional Logic (PL)
In contrast to DB languages or programming languages
- PL is *declarative* rather than procedural
- PL has sufficient expressive power to deal with *partial information*, using disjunction and negation
- PL is *compositional*, can compose complex statements from their sentences and operators
##### Cons of PL
- Meaning is *context-independent*
	- Cannot capture context dependent information, like natural languages "look"
- Limitations on the *expressivity*, can only state *specific truths*, not generic ones
	- Specific truth: B1,1 is a pit
	- Generic truth: Squares adjacent to pits are breezy

with that context, we move onto...
### First Order Logic (FOL)
*Propositional Logic (PL)* assumes the world contains
- Atomic terms for statements
- Operators to combine with atomic statements
**First-order logic (FOL)** assumes the world contains
- *Objects* - people, houses, numbers, ...
- *Relations* - red, round, prime, ....
- *Functions* - father of, best friend, ....
- *Quantification* - all wumpuses smell bad; some squares are breezy
- *Statements* - about objects, relations, functions, and their quantification
> There is higher order logic: Second-order logic also quantifies over relations

##### FOL and Natural Language (NL)
FOL expressivity is closer than PL to NL
FOL statements are *context independent* and *unambiguous*, while NL is still context dependent and ambiguous

##### FOL symbols
- *Constants* - John, 2, ...
- *Variables* - x, y, a, b...
- *Logical operators from PL*
- *Predicates* - True, False, Person, give, more than, ...
	- Person(John)
	- KingOf(John, a)
- *Functions* - Sqrt, LeftLegOf
- *Quantifier* - $\forall, \exists$
- *Equality* - $=$

#### Quantifiers
Be careful with translating NL into FOL using quantifiers
##### For All:
Everyone in ECS170 is smart:
- Good - $\forall x In(x,ESC170) \implies Smart(x)$
- BAD - $\forall x In(x,ESC170) \land Smart(x)$
	- This means everyone is in ECS170 and everyone is smart
##### Exists
Someone in ECS170 is smart:
- Good - $\exists x In(x,ESC170) \land Smart(x)$ 
- BAD - $\exists x In(x,ESC170) \implies Smart(x)$ 
	- This could be true vacuously, even if x is not in ECS170
##### Equality
$term_1=term_2$ is true under a given interpretation if and only if $term_1$ and $term_2$ refer to the same object
- Father(John) = Henry, says that the object referred to by Father(John) and the object referred to by Henry are the same 
#### FOL Syntax in Backus Naur Form
![[FOL-Syntax-Backus-Naur-Form.png|300]]

#### Models in FOL
*Models* in FOL consist of:
- A set of object
- Their relations
- An interpretation that mas
	- Constant symbols -> objects
	- Predicate symbols -> relations
	- Function symbols -> functional relations
