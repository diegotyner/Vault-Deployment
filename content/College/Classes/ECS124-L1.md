[Lecture Slide Link]

## 🎤 Vocab



## ❗ Unit and Larger Context
Important to Frid, her background is there

3-4 assignments
4-5 timed online quizzes
2 midterms
1 final

---
*Goals*
- Role / Utility of bioinformatics in modern bio
- Learn basic biological, mathamatical, and *algorithmic* concepts
- Master common bioinformatical terms
- Do simple programming 
	- PERL??? LOL
	- Other languages too (striving for language agnostic)
- Computational Biology vs. Bioinformatics
	- Scope of Comp. Biology?
		- Modeling processes: modeling based on biological knowledge
	- Bioinformatics?
		- Applications of algorithms and statistical techniques to interpret biological data
		  => leads to understanding biological organization of behavior
How we interpret / obtain info in biology:
1) Observation driven
2) Hypothesis -> Exp.
3) Theory
*or*...
4) Large scale, high-throughput data accumulation
	- Also a form of observation! Just done with a computer in place of human


## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
### T1. Sequence alignment
Used in many places:
- Phylogeny, also species finding
- Relationships
- Migration projects
- Genome sequencing
- Genome assembly
Algorithmically: 
- Dynamic programming

### T2. Database Search
Used:
- BLAS, searches all DNA
- Function similarity (if other similar things create red blood cells, likely this one does too)
- Motif finding
Algorithmically:
- Hashing alignment

### T3. Gene Assembly
Used:
Algorithmically:
- Graph algorithms
- Alignment

> Gene assembly and alignment:

1) Copies strand
2) Blows it up
3) Reads characters chunks at a time (100)
4) If you can read enough characters and find where they overlap, you can rebuild the original
Gluing them together (rebuilding) is graph theory

### T4. Exact String Matching
Uses:
- Finding transposable elements
- Gene search
Algorithmically:
- 122B: Suffix Trees

---
### MACHINE LEARNING SECTION
#### 1. Clustering 
K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering

#### 2. Classification
Naive Bayes, 

Have background data on DNA of people with and without cancer
- Use ML to predict future DNA of unlabeled people
- Estimate probability of both possibilities
Later find out about Broca's Gene associated

#### 3. Phyloenetics
Jukes cantor? 
Ultra metric trees
Nearest Neighbors

#### 4. HMM $\approx$ DP

Tree of knowledge expansion?

*Biological knowledge* - DNA mutates
|
*Biological Model* - Replicate, mutation rate
| 
*Mathematical Model and Assumptions* - Comp. Biology
|
*Mathematical Problem, I/O Description*
|
*Algorithmic Problem / Solution* - Transforms input INTO output
- This level is the focus of the course, high level algorithmic overview
|
*Programming problem* - Grunt work of building the code out
- Done in labs


#### Counting reminder:
##### Stages of experiment
If experiment has multiple stages stage $1 \dots n$ with outcomes $a_1 \dots a_n$ respectively,
- Stage $s_i$ # outcomes is $a_i$
Total sample space size is 
$a_1 \cdot a_2 \cdot \dots \cdots a_n = \prod ^n _{i=1} a_i$
*EX)* If sequence, $4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 \dots = 4^{\text{number of possible items in sequence}}$

##### Picking
How many ways can i select president and VP from a sample 130?
- $nPr = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$
- = $130 * 129$

What about just 2 founders, no roles?
- $nCr = {n \choose r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$
- Dividing by the possible reorderings, that are equivalent orderless
- = 130 * 129 / 2

How many ways to create out of 140 subjects such mating group consists of 3 subjects
- 140 choose 3. 
How many possible mitochondrial sequences (hypothetically 300 long) can exist? Probability of 2 identical sets?
- $4^{300}. \text{ Probability of two identical is } (1/4^{300})^2$

#### Sequence Alignment
*"FACT" (assumption)*
- High DNA / RNA / Protein sequence similarity implies significant function or structural similarity
- Similar sequence implies similar function/structure
	- In RNA it might not be the function, but the structure implied
