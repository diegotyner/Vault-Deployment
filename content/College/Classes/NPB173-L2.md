> The ultimate purpose of the brain and nervous system is to produce complex and adaptable movements

Neurons:
- conduct signals quickly over relatively long distances
- Action potential propogates
- Axons convey signals
- Synapses where axons terminate at junctions with soma or dendrites
- Neurotransmitters

Major cell types of nervous system:
- Glia
	- Glia outnumber neurons. Their importance is not fully understood.
- Oligodendrocytes
- Astrocytes
- Microglia

Nervous system has two parts:
- CNS and PNS
	- Central and Peripheral nervous system
- CNS:
	- Brain and spinal cord
- PNS:
	- Nerves and ganglia outside the brain and spinal cord
- Importance of the distinction:
	- Seperate developmental origin, BBB, different types of support cells, different response to injury

![[Major-Divisions-of-the-CNS.png|600]]
![[Major-Neuroanatomy-Diagram.png|300]]

- At all division, the brain is bilaterally symmetric

### Organization of the Spinal Cord
- Vertical segmental organization, with *31* in total
- Segments or divisions are associated with the entry/exit points of nerve roots between the vertebrae (bones of the spine)
- 5 major divisions, from top to bottom (or rostral to caudal apparently):
1) cervical,
2) thoracic
3) lumbar
4) sacral
5) coccygeal

![[Segmental-Structure-of-the-Spinal-Cord.png]]
- Each segment of the spinal cord is connected to the periphery with a left and right spinal nerve
	- Nerves are bundles of axons
- Each spinal nerve root has a dorsal (back side) and a ventral (belly side)
	- Dorsal root: input, provides sensory info to CNS
	- Ventral root: output, provides motor signals to the periphery
- Cell bodies of primary sensory neurons are located in the dorsal rot ganglion
- Gray matter (cell bodies) surrounded by white matter (nerve fibers)
	- The gray matter is further separated into sensory and motor regions:
		- Dorsal horn is mostly sensory
		- Ventral horn is mostly motor
	- Outer white matter of the spinal cord consists of distinct fiber tracts subserving different functions

- Total amount of white matter increases from the bottom (caudal), to the top (rostral) of the spinal cord
- Amount of gray matter corresponds to musculature ()

#### Mapping between spinal cord segment and body location:
- The area of skin innervated by a single sensory nerve is called a *dermatome*
- The face is not innervated via the spinal cord, instead innervated by the cranial nerves
- Mostly ordered from rostral to caudal along the spinal cord (makes more sense thinking about distribution as a four legged animal rather than human)
- The group of muscles innervated by a single nerve is called a *myotome*
This structure allows deduction of nature of damage

#### Spinal Cord Injuries:
- 6 million people worldwide, around 40 new cases in the US per year per million people
- Most common causes are vehicular accidents, falls, violence (gunshots), and sports injuries. Mostly external trauma
- Can also be due internal factors, tumors or ischemia (inadequate blood supply)
- Can lead to partial or complete loss of motor and/or sensory function in the affected body regions (paralysis)

##### Timecourse:
- Spinal cord injuries most ofen result from compression, stretching, or laceration (cutting)
- Most traumatic injuries have two components, a primary and secondary
	- Primary: Refers to the direct result occurring immedialy at time of initial trauma. This can include severing of axons, death of neurons and glia, and damage to the vasculature
		- Circumscribed damage to neural tissue or other abnormalities are called lesions
	- Secondary: Indirect after effects from processes initiated by the trauma. 
		- Can be as serious as the primary components: traumatic brain injury, a substantial proportion of deaths occur to secondary components unlike other forms of trauma
		- Three phases of secondary spinal cord injury: acute, intermediate, and chronic
			1) Acute: The glial response to the primary injury initiates scar formation. Cut and crushed axons also begin to degenerate distal (away from the cell body) to the site of unjury (*Wallerian degeneration*)
			2) Intermediate and Chronic Phases: Axonal regeneration is limited
*Wallerian Degeneration:*
- An active response to axonal injury. 
- Involves changes in both axons and glial cells along the axons.
- Begins 1-2 days after injury
- Axonal skeleton disintegrates and axonal membrane breaks apart distal to the injury
- Followed by loss of the myelin sheath that surrounded the former axons
- Finally, macrophages clean up the mess

*Myelination:*
- Provided by different cells in CNS and PNS:
	- CNS: Oligondendrocytes, provide multiple segments of myelin and can ensheath many axons
	- PNS: Schwann cell provides only a single segment of myelin, only partially sheaths one axon. 
		- Supports axonal regeneration!
*Regeneration in PNS*
- At the end of Wallerian Degen, the axon forms its *growth cone*, a specialized structure that promotes axon extension
- Route finding usually directed by extracellular environment, but factors used during development are lacking in adulthood
- Schwann cells re-align to form hollow tubes along the previous route of the axon
- Axon growth proceeds through these tubes until the original target is re-innervated
Oligondendrocytes can't do this!

#### Spinal Cord Pathways:
![[Spinal-Cord-Pathways.png]]
- Tracts in the white matter
- Tracts organized by location, not haphazard
- Descending:
	- Subserve motor pathways from the brain to the periphery
- Ascending:
	- Subserve sensory pathways from the periphery to the brain

Ascending:
- Dorsal white column
- Lateral spinothalamic tract
Descending:
- Lateral corticospinal
##### Major Pathways
![[Major-Spinal-Nerve-Pathways.png]]
*Spinothalamic (anterolateral) pathway*
- Carries somatosensory signals
- First order neurons are connected to pain and temperature receptors
- First order neurons have cell bodies in the dorsal root ganglia
- Second order neurons send axons that immediately cross the midline (*decussate*)
- Second order neurons travel up the spinal cord in the anterolateral part of the white matter
- Second order neurons project to neurons in the thalamus
- Third order neurons project from the thalamus to somatosensory cortex

*Dorsal column medial lemniscal pathway - DCML*
- Also carries somatosensory signals
- First-order neurons are connected to touch and proprioceptive receptors
- First order neurons have cell bodies in the dorsal root ganglia
- First order neurons project up the dorsal columns to neurons in the medulla on the same side of body as their receptors
- Second order neurons send axons that immediately cross the midline (*decussate*)
- Second order neurons travel up the medial lemniscus
- Second neurons project to neurons in the thalamus
- Third order neurons project from the thalamus to somatosensory cortex

*Lateral Corticospinal (pyramidal) pathway*
- Lateral corticospinal pathway carries motor signals (mostly for limbs)
- Upper motor neurons have cell bodies in cortex (M1)
- Upper motor neuron axons immediately cross the midline before entering the spinal cord and don't cross again
- Thus axons are on the same side of the muscles they control throughout the length they travel in the spinal cord
- Upper motor neuron axons project in the lateral column of the spinal cord to lower motor neurons in the ventral horn
- Lower motor neuron axons project throughout the ventral root to directly innervate muscles on the same side
