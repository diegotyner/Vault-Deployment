### Week 1 - Intro & Techniques
[Intro Techniques Local](file:///C:\Users\diego\OneDrive\Documents\College_Files\Junior\NPB163\Intro-Techniques.pdf)
[[NPB163-Problem-Set-1]]
#### Techniques:
- Levels of analysis for each question
The key things to focus on:
1) What does it measure?
2) What is its spatial resolution? (single / multi unit, populational, etc. )
	- Single neuron, neuron in an area, whole brain, etc.
3) Temporal resolution? (Measuring a precise action potential, or more like a BOLD activity? )
4) Proper situation to employ activity?
	- Is invasiveness necessary?

##### Scratch Notes of each
**Extracellular Recordings:** 
- Invasive technique, measures with a tiny metal sharp tip with an electrode. Needs to be placed directly on area of interest
- Has very limited coverage, only recording from one spot. 
- Used for *single-unit recordings*, where the external voltage of a single neuron is recorded
- How strong recorded voltage is depends on distance from soma and size of neuron
- Frequently get data in the form of raster plots or peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs)
- Can also be used for Multi-unit activity (MUA) and for Local Field Potentials (LFP)
- Can also get wider coverage with multi electrode arrays (Utah arrays IE)
**Intracellular Recordings:**
- Advantage is that they are able to track IPSPs and EPSPs through inner membrane voltage. However, they are difficult to perform, especially in vivo
**Electrocorticography (ECoG) / intracranial EEG (iEEG)**
- An electrode grid is placed on cortical surface and provides LFP like signals from it
- High spatial coverage (covers a large amount of cortex) but low spatial resolution (records on the scale of LFPs and not direct neuron activity)
**Optical Imaging**
- Part of the skull is removed to allow imaging of cortical surface with a CCD camera, which can be combined with the light absorption properties of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin (HbO2 and HbR to provide metabolic information about neural activity
- An increase in neural activity is followed by a relatively fast and local reduction in hemogoblin oxygenation, followed by a slower and slightly more global increase in blood flow/volume and hemoglobin oxygenation
	- Optical imaging will pick up the first spike, will fMRI picks up the second
- Depending on wavelength of illumination chosen, changes in  total hemoglobin and/or changes in hemoglobin oxygenation can be measured
**Voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) / Calcium Sensitive dye (CaSD) imaging**
- VSC can be used to directly measure image electrical activity. VSDs bind across a neuro's membrane and change their flourescence according to membrane ponetial.
- Calcium-sensitive dyes are instead sensitive to intracellular calcium concentration, and are sensitive to the calcium influx of a neuron firing. 
- They provide a larger signal, but are more difficult to get into neurons.
**EEG**
**MEG**
**fMRI**

**Photoreceptors**
- Located on the retina (back of the eye)
- 4 different types
	- 1 rod
	- 3 types of cones
		- L cones (red), M cones (green), S cones (blue)
