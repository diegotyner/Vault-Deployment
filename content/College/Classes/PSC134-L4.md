## 🎤 Vocab


## ❗ Unit and Larger Context
> Which aspects of thought and behavior seem naturally explainable in terms of the detector model of the neuron?
- Perceiving sensory things lends easily
- Directing attention and resources and seeing more resources lends itself easier
- Active recall
- Cognitive disorders, small alterations to the model can lead to noisy detection like we saw in the lab


> Which aspects of thought and behavior **don't** seem naturally explainable in terms of the detector model of the neuron?
- Subconsious decisions?
- Combinations of large amounts of neuron
- Internal monologue
- Consciousness / Why is there a first person perspective?
- Non-stimulus based cognition
- Trauma responses?




## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
The learning question above about feasibility of the detector model was to question how close the above can take us toward the brain-in-the-vat scenario.

### Excitatory and Inhibitory Neurons
Excitatory = main info processing, 85% of neuron, long range connections
Inhibitory = local, activity regulation and competition
> competitive dynamics between neurons?


The entire cortex has 6 layers. 

- A area = Exceptionally large layer 4, processes inputs coming in from thalamus and visual world
- B = Expansions of layers 2 and 3. Internal processing of information.
- C = Expansions of layers 5 and 6. Specialized for motor outputs and for acting on the world.
- D - Prefrontal cortical region = Has all players

Layer 1 = Sometimes gets included with the hidden layers (2, 3)
![[Layers-of-Cortex.png | 500]]
- Solid lines are strong connections between layers
- Dashed lines are weaker, and we don't include them in our models
- Layers can only inhibit themselves
This is a simplified introduction

### Connections are largely symmetric:

- The image above shows the strength of the connection from one area to another

### Biology -> Function
- Feedforward excitation -> Categorization
- Feedback excitation -> Attractor Dynamics
- Lateral Inhibition -> Competition, regulation
> The value of neural processing lies in transforming information, not just copying it.


### Detectors Naturally Perform Categorization
Categorizing things properly is at least 80% of the solution to any problem:
- Object recog
- Spoken word recog
- Idiom recog
- Relationship recog
- Person recog
- Action recog
- ...

### Representations
We want them to be:
- Graded
- Distributed (e.g. coarse coding) 
	-> 
- Simultaneously capture multiple meanings
- Capture similarity
- Efficient
- Simplified (e.g. stereotypes)

### Coarse Coding Efficiency





## 🧪-> Example
- List examples of where entry contents can fit in a larger context

## 🔗 -> Related Word
- Link all related words
