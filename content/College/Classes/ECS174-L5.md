Variety of Factors form edges:

### Image Gradient:
Rapid changes in the image indicate edges. Edges $\iff$ Spikes in first derivative of image intensity.
$$
\nabla f = [\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}]
$$

Differentiating a digital image F\[x,y\]?
Option 1) Reconstruct a continuous image, then take gradient
Option 2) Take a discrete derivative ("finite difference")
$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \approx F[x + 1,\, y]-F[x,y]
$$
The **gradient direction** is given by 
$$
\theta = tan^{-1}(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \;/\; \frac{\partial f}{\partial x})
$$
The **edge strength** is given by the norm/magnitude
$$
||\nabla f || = \sqrt{(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x})^2 + (\frac{\partial f}{\partial y})^2}
$$

### Noise
Difference detectors react strongly to noise

### Canny Edge Detector
> This is probably the most widely used edge detector in computer vision
