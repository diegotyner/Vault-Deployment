## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
> Visual perception
> - The perceptual representation of spatial relationships is generally accepted that multiple representations of space coexist and cooperate in generating our perceptual understanding of the visual world. 
> - In one of the most well-developed theories of high-level visual perception and cognition, Kosslyn (1994) argues for a distinction between two fundamental types of spatial representation—coordinate and categorical. 
>   
> - Coordinate representations encode: Metric relations of distance, orientation, and size (e.g., two inches long, 60° angle). 
> - Kosslyn suggests that they play an important role in the visuomotor control of reaching, grasping, and throwing behaviors as well as in the programming of saccadic eye movements. 
> - In addition, they may contribute to object recognition when it is necessary to discriminate between objects that have subtle shape differences (e.g., the neck of a swan vs. that of goose).


> Categorical representations
> - Encode fairly large equivalence classes of schematic spatial relationships between entities (e.g., connected/disconnected, left/right, above/below, near/far, etc.). 
> - Because of their generality, these representations are useful for specifying the rough locations of different objects relative to one another 
> - A major another major function of categorical representations is in object recognition. 
> - “ very few types of objects must be discriminated based purely on the metric spatial relations among their parts. Rather, to identify a stimulus as a member of a category, such as a dog or bike, one needs to ignore the precise spatial arrangements among parts—which vary for different exemplars” (Kosslyn, 1994, p. 193)


> Neural substrates of spatial representations
> - Both hemispheres contribute to both coordinate and categorical spatial representations
> - Right parietal cortex is dominant for coordinate ones and the left for categorical ones.
> - Lesion studies have shown that tasks requiring coordinate representations—such as determining whether two angles have the same orientation.

**Gerstman's Syndrome** - Inability to judge left from right (categorical decision)

*Hemisphere Specialization*:
- Right hemisphere is faster than the left for judging coordinate relations
- Left hemisphere is faster than the right for judging categorical relations
