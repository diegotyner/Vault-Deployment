## 🎤 Vocab



## ❗ Unit and Larger Context
Small summary



## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
### Hippocampal System
![[Hippocampal-System.png]]
 Association Areas -> Hippocampus Proper (Dentate Gyrus / CA3 / CA1)
 Hippocampus Proper (Dentate Gyrus / CA3 / CA1)
 - Form sparse representations
	 - Don't suffer from as much *interference*
	 - Overall activity lower than other brain regions
 - **CA3** - Recurrent excitatory connection. 
	 - When neurons become active, send input to other units in that layer (pattern completion, filling in missing gaps in information)
		 - Super useful for completing incomplete memories, in the form of cues
 - **CA1** - Forms an invertible representation. Can be used to feed into entorhinal cortex, or from.
 - **Entorhinal Cortex** - Rich contextual information
 - **Subiculum** - 
 - Generalized Memory: Cortical, the posterior cortex, frontal lobe


#### Sparse Activity
CA1CS, CA3CS: Sparse and selective
Entorhinal Cortex, Subiculum: Very active, very distributed. Hard to decode.

#### Complementary Learning Systems Framework
##### Remember Specifics:
- Separate representation
- Fast learning (encode immediately)
- Learn automatically (encode everything)
- *Hippocampus*
##### Extract Generalities
- Overlapping reps
- Slow learning (integrate over days)
- Task-driven learning (extract relevant stuff)
- *Neocortex*

### Moving Forwards
Reflect on the brain secreting the mind question. Think about *why* we couldn't switch the brain regions
The hippocampus with its episodic memory couldn't be switched with the ventral visual processing stream's object recognition
- Sparse self completing memories $\neq$ General attractor dynamics in object recognition


### Two forms of neural memory
#### Activation
Activation
- Neurons continue to fire action potentials, 'remembering' what you were just seeing, thinkin
- When firing stops, you forget
**Features**
- Transient, easily lost
- Very flexible: mental arithmetic, etc

#### Synaptic Changes
Synapses change strength (“weight”) as a result of LTP / LTD (learning): this encodes long-term memories that last even after your activation switches to something new.
**Features:**
- Long lasting, persist over distraction, etc
- Very high capacity

### The Brain IS Memory
Memory is located in every single synapse in the brain
> There are as many different kinds of memory as there are neurons and synapses and brain areas.
#### Sensory Memory
Just neural firing in sensory brain areas – those neurons just keep on firing away (briefly)
#### STM
Neural firing in higher level brain areas that represent specific thing you're remembering – those neurons just keep on firing away (briefly)
> Usually requires contribution from PFC to keep neurons firing longer (extra 'holding power')
#### LTM
It is in the relevant brain area(s) that encode the specific information! LTM is the sum total of all those synaptic weight changes!
