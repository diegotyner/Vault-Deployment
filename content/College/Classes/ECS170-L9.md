[Games and Adversarial Search Review](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/984669/files/folder/Lecture%20Slides?preview=27425028)


## 🎤 Vocab



## ❗ Unit and Larger Context
### Review of Games and Adversarial Search
Minimax v.s. MCTS, Which is best depends on
- Accuracy of evaluation function for minimax or alpha-beta, versus
- Selection policy of MCTS
If a single move can change the course of the game, MCTS might not find it.
- Algorithms can combine minimax and MCTS
### Non Classical Search
Local Search as Optimization
- Introduction: local search and optimization problems
- Hill Climbing
- Simulated Annealing
- Beam Search
AND-OR Search in Non-Deterministic Environments
- Belief States and AND-OR Search



## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes

> All problems can be formulated as search problems with varying levels of complexities. In this class we will cover the most straightforward ones


### Local Search
- When path to goal doesn't matter, you only care about the goal state
- Iterate
	- Remember only current state
	- Move to best neighboring state, forget the past

Advantages:
- Low memory usage
- Often finds reasonable solutions in large/infinite state spaces
- Useful for solving optimization problems

#### Optimization
Find or approximate best state according to some objective function $f$ (as the criterion for achieving the problem goal)

Usually can find an optimal solution when the search space is convex, or the objective function is convex

**Optimization** - Finds a global maximum or minimum
**Local Search** - Finds the best state (the lowest valley or the highest peak) in the state space

#### Hill Climbing
Given the current state $n$, and an evaluation function $f(n)$, and a successor state $s_{next}$, we want to find a reachable state $s$ that maximizes $f(s)$: 
- If $f(s_{next}) \geq f(n)$ then move to $s_next$
- Else, halt at n
Terminates when a peak is reach
Has *no look-ahead* beyond the immediate neighbors of the current state
Chooses a random best successor if there is more than one
*Cannot backtrack*, since it doesn't remember where it's been

How to avoid local maxima?
- Randomly generate initial state, conduct search from there
- Works very well with few local maxima


| Pros                        | Cons                                                      |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Convex problems solved fast | Real problems rarely convex                               |
|                             | If downhill moves not allowed, cannot escape local maxima |
|                             | Random restart is complete, but very inefficient          |


#### Simulated Annealing
- Combine hill climbing with a random walk in some way that yields both efficiency and completeness
- Basic idea: allows to pick an action that results in a worse state, but gradually diminishes this probability

> Adopt a control parameter T (also called "temperature")
> - T controls the probability 𝑝 in picking a worse successor
> - T starts out high to promote escape from local maxima early on
> - T gradually decreases toward 0 over time to avoid getting thrown off track late in the search (based on a “schedule” function)

#### Beam Search
Hill climbing only keeps track of one best state

*Beam search* keeps track of k states in memory
> - starts with 𝑘 randomly selected initial states
> - Find successors of all 𝑘 states
> - Take top 𝑘 successors across all successors and put them in memory
> - repeat
