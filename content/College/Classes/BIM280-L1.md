[Lecture Slide Link]

## 🎤 Vocab



## ❗ Unit and Larger Context
Intro to Braiin - Neuroanatomy and Neural Cicuits 
Neurophysiology

BMI Applics - Chapin, Moxon et al.





## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
Rat recordings of pressing lever
Using recordings to detect future ressings

*PCA as a neural op funct*

Robot arm hard, have to account for momentum and intertia

2024 Braingate: RNN for mullti cursor control

Posterior Parietak cortex (PPC)
- Transforming viz info into motor commands
M1, Premotor corttex, supplementary motor area (SMA)

Corticospinal Tract (pyramidal track)
- descending pathway for voluntary movement humans
- axons: m1, SMA, premotor are fibers making tract
- only direct pathway from cortex to the spine
	- > million fibers

##### Subcortical Structures
- Striatum
	- Collective name for several structure
	- Important in BG
	- Parkinsons, disfunction in dopamine response
- Globus Pallidus
- Substatia nigra
- Thalamus
	-  "Relay station"
	- relays info from sbcortical areas and the cortex

##### Pathways
Info transmitted multiple loops. Very confusing and interconnected, this is mostly for our understanding. None really seperate. 
*Motor Loops*
*Oculomotor Loop*
*Prefrontal Loop*
*Limbic Loop*

##### Spinal Cord
**Corticospinal Tract (CST)** main pathway for voluntary control.
compsed of both white and gray matter.
"Butterfly pattern" / Crosss section of spinal cord resembles it
- Grey matter (cell bodies), White matter (axons), white becausue myelin sheath. 

Ventral Horn of the spine?


#### Muscle
Eventually, the end goal of pathways will be motor activation.


*Involuntary Motor Control* - Handled by other networks, like the brain stem. and the pons.
- Breathing
- Heart rate
- Blood pressure
- Body temperature

*Modeling* - Needs to simplify phenomena, while retaining acuracy. If no assumptions, then its just the original system.
*EX:*
- In order to control voluntary movements


### Hist of Neural control
Wilder Penfield (1930s) - Montreal Procedure
- Inactivating cortex, and seeing if its critical before insicion
- Used to explor emotor homonculus

At the same time, a lot of work in exploring the implications of neurnsn have electrical signal
- 1875 Caton EEG
- 1926 Adrian first neural activity: discovery of AP
- 1952 Hodkin and Huxley understanding mechanisms of AP
	- Nonlinear equations based on work with giant squid axon
- 1969 Evarts: Neuron encoding neural control info
- 1970 Humphrey et al.: Multiple single neuron recording
