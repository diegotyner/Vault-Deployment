### Midterm 1:
##### Course Intro
*Neuroethology* - Neural basis of natural behaviors. Neuro + ethology.
*Tinbergen's Four Questions*
*Choosing model system*
*Ethogram*
*FAP*

##### Orienting
*More FAP*
*Applying Tinbergen's Qs*
*Orienting Movements*

##### Toad Prey Localization
[Provided Study Guide](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/948282/pages/toad-prey-catching-behavior-summary-slash-study-guide?module_item_id=2186657)
> How does a toad recognize prey?

*Toad Prey Capture*

*"The Neural Basis of Visually Guided Behavior" Paper*

##### Bat Echolocation Part 1
*Recap of Innate/Learned Behavior*
*Active vs Passive Sensory Systems*
*Sound Equations:* 
- *Speed=Freq x Wavelength*

*Song-control system pathways (2)*
*Sexual Dimorphism? (zebra finch)*
*Hormonal effects: organizational vs activational*
*Song Development*

##### Birdsong 2
##### Birdsong 3

##### Locomotion
##### Crayfish
##### Fish

### Post Midterms:
##### Navigation and Place Fields

##### Olfaction
> - Differences and similarities between the Main Olfactory System and the Accessory olfactory system. Included the structures involved.
> - Salmon spawning behavior (but not the life cycle in detail)
> - Olfactory Imprinting in Ewes. (evidence of imprinting and the importance of olfaction)
> - Necrophoresis. Be able to explain what it is and the impact of oleic acid.
> - Importance of TRP2 to the accessory olfactory system (Don't worry about the other molecules)
> - Phenotypes/Findings when examining the TRP2 KO, het and WT males.
> - Why olfaction is hard to study.
