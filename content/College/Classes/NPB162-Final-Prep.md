### Midterm 1:
##### Course Intro
*Neuroethology* - Neural basis of natural behaviors. Neuro + ethology.
*Tinbergen's Four Questions:*
1) Ontogeny - How does it develop in an individual
2) Mechanism/Causation - What mechanistacally causes the trait
3) Phylogeny/Evolution - Evolutioary history?
4) Adaptive Significance/Survival Value - How have trait variations influenced fitness
*Choosing model system*
- Characterize animal - Ethogram: Entire behavioral reportoire of an animal species
- Best model:
	- Behavior that is: simple, robust, readily accessible, ethologically relevant
	- Animal should be: inexpensive, suitable for lab study, easy to maintain, easy to breed
*Ethogram* - Entire behavioral reportoire of an animal species
*FAP:*
- A complex behavior with multiple steps
- Continue to completion despite interruption
- An innate behavior
- Triggered by a sign stimuli
	- Releasing value. Bigger means more reliable in eliciting FAP.

##### Orienting
*More FAP*

*Orienting Movements*

*C. Elegans:*
- What is AFD?
- AIY promotes thermophilic behaviors
- AIZ promotes cryophilic behaviors

##### Toad Prey Localization
[Provided Study Guide](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/948282/pages/toad-prey-catching-behavior-summary-slash-study-guide?module_item_id=2186657)
> How does a toad recognize prey?

*Toad Prey Capture*
- Orienting -> Binocular fixation -> Snapping -> Swallowing -> Wiping mouth
*Toad Visual System*
- Projections from the retina to the optic tectum and thalamic pretectum (TP) through the optic nerve
	- Cross at chiasm
*Receptive Visual Fields & Responses*
- RGCs and LGNs 
	- On/Off surround
	- Responds to ERF, inhibited by IRF (_ Receptive Field)
- Thalamic pretectal neuron, Type TH3m aka TP3
	- Activated by stimuli eliciting evasion
	- Square > Antiworm > Worm
	- If lesioned, toads will respond to any stimulus. Unable to inhibit for non-prey. 
- Tectal Neuron Type T5 (1)
	- Longer stimulus in the direction of movement: strongest response
	- Square > Worm > Antiworm
- Tectal Neuron Type T5 (2)
	- Response biggest with size in axis perpendicular to direction of movement
	- Worm > Square > Antiworm
	- BEST MATCH TO BEHAVIOR
	- Stimulation in thalamic pretectum causes inhibition to these cells
*Pathway, involved cells, etc.*
*Optic Tectum*
- Stimulation of a certain part causes turning to a part of the visual field
