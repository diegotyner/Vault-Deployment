## ❗ Unit and Larger Context
### Energy and Harmony:
Hopfield and Smolensky both studied this from different angles
$$
\displaylines{
E = -\frac{1}{2}\sum_j \sum_i x_i w_{ij}y_i \\
H = \frac{1}{2}\sum_j \sum_i x_i w_{ij}y_i
}
$$
> Key is that either shows that Ge (dot prod) improves overall state:
$$
\frac{\partial H}{\partial y_i} = \sum x_i w_{ij}
$$


![[Feedforward-Feedback-Dynamics.png | 500]]
Sims simplify inhibition via equations without actual inhibitory interneurons:
$$
\displaylines{
g(t) = G_i [ff(t) + fb(t)] \\
ff(t) = FF[<g_e> - FF0]+ \\
fb(t) = fb(t-1) + dt[FB<y> - fb(t-1)]
}
$$



## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
T*H*E C*A*T - H and A are visually the same, but we can choose how to interpret it
Green Needle vs. Brain Storm - We can decide which to perceive, with the sound being the same

Feedforward excitation => categorization
Feedback excitation => attractor dynamics
Lateral inhibition => competition, regulation

An example of attractor dynamics is top down ambiguity resolution. The first time seeing the picture of a dalmatian, we have no idea what we're looking at. Our classifications are chaotic and unsure. After knowing that it's a dalmatian, we get attracted to that idea and finally our stimulus to classification resolves and gets attracted to that decision. Subsequent viewing immediately see it.
