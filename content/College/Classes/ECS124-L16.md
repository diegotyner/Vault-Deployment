*Which model - Classifiation is responsible for sequence*

![[ECS124-L16 2025-03-11 18.22.33.excalidraw]]

What is the most likely path that generated observation GGCATGAA
What is the prob of set path:
- `LLHHHLLL`
- `GGCATGAA`

$$\displaylines{(0.5)\;(.2)\;(.6)(.2)\\(.4)(.3)\;(.5)(.2)\dots}$$
- `.5` is the probability of moving into either state to start
- Then, probability of selecting any letter
- Then, probability of state transitioning * the probability of any letter in that state

### Dynamic Probability: Alignment Recurrence

```
x[1...n-1]x(n)
y[1...m-1]y(m)
OPT(n,m) = 

GGCAT
OPT(T,5) = probability of letter T in position 5 printing from model H
= P_H(T)
```


$OPT_H(T,5) = P_H(T) \cdot max[\; (OPT_H(A,4) \cdot \text(stay)),\;\; (OPT_T(A,4) \cdot \text(T->H))\;]$
- In english:
	- The best path that takes you to A 
	*times*
	- The highest probability of producing T from model H

```
// E = transition edge probabilities
OPT_L(C,3)=P_L(C) * max( 
	OPT_H(G,2) * E[E, L], 
	OPT_L(G,2) * E[L, L], 
)
```



|     | 1               | 2                     | 3   | 4   | 5   |
| --- | --------------- | --------------------- | --- | --- | --- |
|     | G               | G                     | C   | A   | T   |
| H   | $0.5 \cdot 0.3$ | -> $(.15) \cdot (.3)$ |     |     |     |
| L   | $0.5 \cdot 0.2$ |                       |     |     |     |
- Probability of up to (H,j) = (H,1)

Then, to calculate subsequent cells:
```
OPT(H,2)=prob(G in H) * max(
	OPT(H,1) * E[H,H],
	OPT(L,1) * E[L,H]
)
// Solving gives:
= (.3) * max(
	(.5)(.3) * (.5),
	(.5)(.2) * (.4)
)
// Max is the first option


OPT(L,2)=prob(G in L) * max(
	OPT(L,1) * E[L,L],
	OPT(H,1) * E[H,L]
)
```

### topics?
#### Markov Chains
1) Given a path and emissions, calc the prob the path geenrated the emissions
2) Provide the most prob path given emissions, viterbi algo
#### Phylogeny
1) Type characteristics, ultrametric tress, adaptive trees
2) 2 algo for finding phylogenetic trees
	1) UPGMA
	2) Neighbor-joining -> u(cluster)
#### Suffix Tree / Data Structure
Genome assembly to find reference locations 
or if searching for a gene in a genome:
- If we have a long text, we can search for short patterns

1) Helpful genome assembly for assembly w/ reference genome


#### Clustering 
1) K-means
2) Heirarchical
	1) UPGMA
	2) Nearest Neighbor

##### Pros and Cons:
**K-Means**
- Good for learning about data
- First step to classification

**Hierarchical**
- The hierarchical data is good for phylogeny

#### Supervised Learning
Good for classification
We learned about Naive Bayes
