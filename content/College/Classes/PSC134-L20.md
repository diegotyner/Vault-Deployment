## ❗ Unit and Larger Context
How does brain secrete mind?
- Neurons are detectors
- Network dynamics
	- Competition
	- Attractors
	- ...
- Upbringing, nature
- Synapses, plasticity, 
- Moving from a where/what to a how/why analyses
- Cortical 
- Specialized mechanisms in hippocampus make it better for learning memories
	- Fast encoding of episodic memory
	- Damage/amnesia
- Specialized pathways of what/where in visual cortex can help with object recognition
- Go / No Go pathways in basal ganglia. Choosing between rewarding choices, RL
	- Most rewarded goal is also an issue, infant studies (A not B, toddler card task switching)

### Issues and Resolutions
- Models help us to understand phenomena.  
-  Models deal with complexity.  
-  Models are explicit, deconstruct psychological  
constructs.  
-  Models allow control.  
-  Models provide a unified framework.



## 🧪 -> Example
> 1. That is, how do our neural systems lead us to think and act -- to perceive the world, attend, understand, learn, remember, read, speak, pursue goals -- in the ways that we do? 
```
1. 
Our neural systems are organized in ways that help us todirect activation in helpful ways to solve problems. Our neurons fundamentally serve as detectors, helping to signal change and new meanings (when looking from a rate code perspective) and depending on the brain area are differently connected/activated to encourage meaningful activity. The weights between neurons are learned through experience, reward, and error as they get adjusted, gradually leading the brain towards an optimum state of behavior. As our brains develop through infancy and childhood, our brains are highly plastic and latch on to new concepts hard and fast. As we mature in adulthood our connections are less plastic and more about refining the existing network we have, similar to our learning rate decreasing over time. 
More specifically, our neural systems pick up information through our sensory system (mechanoreceptors, photoreceptors), and this information gets routed (thalamus) towards the system organized best to process them (somatosensory, visual cortex). 
Then, these sensory signals get interpreted from our higher level networks that take action based on higher level concepts like goals, memories, strategies, and emotion.

> 2. How confident are you in your answer, 1-7. 1 not confident, 7 very confident.
```
6
```
> 3. How does your answer today compare to what you wrote on Day 1?
>    a. 1=the same, 7=very different
>    b. Confidence from day 1 to today, decrease - same - increase?
>    c. Explain
```
a. 5
b. Increased from 5-6
c. My answers initially were mostly focused around lower level biology in the brain than network dynamics. I spoke very generally about how it originates from neurons and glia, to lower level sensing, and very briefly about higher level processing. Now, I wrote more about network dynamics and organization and how that leads to creating the mind. My answers were different, but not that inaccurate.
