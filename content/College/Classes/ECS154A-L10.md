> Design electronic lock which opens when user enters 3 values in correct sequence

### 2 buttons
L+R
Opens when LRL

States: $Y_0, Y_1, \dots$
Inputs: $X_0, X_1, \dots$
Outputs: $Z_0, Z_1, \dots$

- Moore model

### Moore Model
Output function *only* of the state
### Mealy Model
Output is a function of the *state and input*
- The above lock scenario is a Moore model


#### Pros and Cons:
- Mealy models use less states
	- They are cheaper
- Moore models are more stable
	- Computers want stability, are Moore models

### 5 Steps to Designing an SSC
**SSC** - Synchronous Sequential Circuit

1) Model provided specs (make state transition diagram)
2) Minimize the number of states in the model
3) Create State Transition Table
4) Select flip-flops and write flip-flop equations
5) Design the combo logic

> Assume machine M1:
> - Single input, single output SSC which determines if previous 4 inputs constitute valid BCD (binary coded decimal) codeword

Refresher: BCD = Binary Coded Decimal = 0000-1001

z to indicate valid, z=1 invalid
least significant bit appears 1st in time, each clock new x presented oldest X discarded

- Continues on for all 16 inputs

- Group inputs, as we see there are identical inputs/outputs
	- A: 000, 001
	- B: 010, 011
	- C: 100, 101
	- D: 110, 111

| Current State | Next<br>x=0 | State<br>x=1 | Output<br>x=0 | Output<br>x=1 |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------- |
| A             | A           | C            | 0             | 0             |
| B             | A           | B            | 0             | 1             |

- Theoretically could combine C and D, but need 2 flip flops for 3 inputs or 4 so no real benefit
- Need to assign states to names
	- A: $Y_0=0, Y_1=0$
	- B: $Y_0=0, Y_1=1$
	- C: $Y_0=1, Y_1=0$
	- D: $Y_0=1, Y_1=1$
- This representation will be the language our circuit works in
