## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
### Bioinformatics Design Process:
Set Biological Knowledge -> Requirements
- Well defined problems
Design Algorithms that solve the problem meet the requirements

#### Motivation
DNA:
- A,T,C,G
RNA:
- A,U,C,G
Protein:
- 20 amino acid dictionary

#### Homology:
Same sequence because of an ancestor
> In general, we assume change is very unlikely...
> If two animals have a common ancestor, we can assume that one (humans) changed x from the ancestor
> We can assume the other (mice) changed y from the ancestor
> We can assume that x+y should be minimal...

H: AT
M: AC
Could have been:
- A_ -> AC
- \_T -> \_C -> AC
delete A, mutate to C, add A

*Given:* 
2 sequences s1 and s2: 

Output: similarity score AND change history that converts s1 to s2

Changes that can occur:
- Mutation - One amino acid changing to another. A->T
- Deletion - DNA repair. A->_
- Insertion - When a virus jumps into it. A\_ -> AT

**Similarity Score Between Two Sequences**
sim(s1, s2) = account for the cost of editing s1 to s2 using biological process of mutating, deletion, insertion
sim(s1, s2) = max( # matches - # mismatches - # spaces )
- Max across all possible alignments of s1 and s2
Alignment s1, s2: Sequencs $\hat
