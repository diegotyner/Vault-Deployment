```
def BF_Drive(	) {
	
	for i=0 to 2^n:
		breakpoints = decode(breaks, i)
		if is_valid(breakpoints) {
			min_cost = cost(breakoints_selected)
			best_set = breakpoints 
		}
	return best set
}
```

```
O(n)
def is)valid(int[] backpack, int[] h, int c) {
	use greedy strategy to check => if this option can read end the return true
	=> return false
}
```

Remember the difference between general and optimal recurrence
- i vs n
