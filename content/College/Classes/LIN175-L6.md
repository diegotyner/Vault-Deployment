Uber late, only caught last 20 mins



## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
### Catch up
Techniques to measure brain activity in space:
- fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging)
- fNIRS (functional near- infrared spectroscopy)
- PET (positron emission tomography)

#### Measuring blood flow:
- Neuronal metabolism
- Brain cell activity is powered by glucose an oxygen, supplied vja blood flow
- Neuronal activity leads to increased local oxygen consumption

- Contrast with EEG / MEG neural electromagnetic effects

### Physics of MRI
![[Physics-of-MRI.png]]
- Protons spin are aligned by a strong magnetic field
	- Spins are added together and result in a net magnetization vector (NMV)
- They are perturbed by a radio wave
	- Excitation
- The recovery of the protons to the aligned orientation is measured
	- Relaxation

Theres a T1 and T2 weighted image that highlight distinct things. In the example he gave, a T2 weighted image showed a tumor and edema much more clearly.


#### fMRI
Measures the differences of blood composition across time, due to oxygenation differences of blood

Hemoglobin (Hb) protein carried by red blood cells picks up oxygen from lungs to cells to maintain viability
- Results in 2 states:
	- Oxygenated Hb - HbO2
		- Oxygenated blood is 'paramagnetic' (differences in iron)
	- Deoxygenated - HbR (reduced)
