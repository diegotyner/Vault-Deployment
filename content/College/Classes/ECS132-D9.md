Type of Hypothesis Testing:
- Proportion
- Difference in means
- Single Sample
One tail or two tail?

Example:
> Flip a coin 50 times and see 30 heads
> Claim: The test is unfair
> Test your claim with 95% significance level

1) *State the hypothesis*
$H_o: p=0.5, H_a: p\neq 0.5$
2) *Compute the test statistic*
$\hat{p}=30/50=0.6$
3) *p-value/critical value/confidence interval*
For this example, using confidence interval
$p\in \hat{p} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \cdot se(\hat{p})$
	z-crit of two tailed 95% significance is *1.96*
	se of proportion is $\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}$
$p = 0.6 \pm 1.96\cdot \sqrt{\frac{0.6(0.4)}{50}}$
$p\in [0.464, 0.735]$
4) *Conclusion/Decision*
> Since p=0.5 is contained inside the 95% CI, we fail to reject (FTR) the null hypothesis and conclude that the dice is fair with 95% level of confidence
> 
> Confidence Interval: I'm 95% sure that the true mean lies in between [low, high] where the variance ($\sigma^2$) can be approximated by $s^2$ (sample variance).

*Example)* Given salmon and tuna weights as follows:

|                            | Salmon | Tuna |
| -------------------------- | ------ | ---- |
| Sample Average ($\bar{x}$) | 20     | 15   |
| Sample Variance $s^2$      | 1      | 2    |
| Sample Size ($n$)          | 15     | 20   |
At 3% significance level, test the claim that salmon pop weight is at least 2lbs more than the population on average.

1) *State hypothesis*
$H_o: \mu_s - \mu_T \geq 2, H_a: \mu_s - \mu_T < 2$
2) *Test Statistic*
$t = \frac{obs_value - null_value}{obs_sd}$
$t = \frac{(\bar{x_s} - \bar{x_t}) - ({x_s} - {x_t})}{\sqrt{\frac{s^2_s}{n_s} + \frac{s^2_t}{n_t}}} = \frac{(20-15) -2}{\sqrt{1/15 + 2/20}} = 7.34$
3) *p-value/critical value/97% CI*
option a:
$p-val = P(z \leq \frac{7.34 - 2}{\sqrt{1/15 + 2/20}}) = P(z\leq 13.09) = 1$
	z-crit for 97% significance is *1.88*
