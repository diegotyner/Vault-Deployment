## ❗ Information
> One prediction from the complementary learning systems perspective regarding this consolidation process is that the information encoded in the neocortex will be of a different character to that initially encoded by the hippocampus, due to the very different nature of the learning and representations in these two systems. Thus, to the extent that episodic memories can be encoded in the neocortex, they will become more “semanticized” and generalized, integrating with other existing memories, as compared to the more distinct and crisp pattern separated representations originally encoded in the hippocampus. Available evidence appears to support this idea, for example by comparing the nature of the intact memories from hippocampal amnesics to neurologically intact controls

It was very interesting for me how broad the responsibility of memory is. In the past I usually thought of memory as being a modular process handled by the hippocampus, and it's a bit mind boggling to try and wrap my head around how it could work with it being such a complicated process and involving so many centers of the brain.

```
I found it particularly surprising how memories can be spread outside of the hippocampus to be encoded in other parts of the brain if they're reactivated from those parts of the brain regularly enough. It's difficult for me to imagine how the brain could separate memory from reality or function with that being the case, and it makes me appreciate how difficult the problem of memory is, especially one shot memory.
