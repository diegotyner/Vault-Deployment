## ❗ Unit and Larger Context
> Started from "Mapping receptive fields (2)", page 21


## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
### Simple Cells and Complex Cells
Simple Cells - Spatial Frequency tuning
Complex Cells - Orientation tuning, and movement

#### Mapping Receptive Fields (3):
White noise stimulus and reverse correlation
Find the most active random patterns for a neuron, and average them?
- Get out almost a heatmap for the receptive field
- However, the prior for this is that cells are independents.
	- For complex cells that need relationships between cells, it won't capture relationships

#### Neural Maps in V1
##### 1. Retinotopic Maps

##### 2. Orientation preference maps
- Pinwheel centers
Direction selectivity of individual neurons near pinwheel centers

##### 3. Ocular Dominance Map (inputs to granular layer)

#### Visual Processing Beyond V1

Proposed functional roles:
1) Dorsal Pathways
	- "Where" pathway
	- Vision for action
2) Ventral Pathways
	- "What" pathways
	- Vision for perception

#### Motion Processing
##### MT / MST
Neurons in area MT (middle temporal area; V5) respond selectively to visual motion and are direction tuned

Directional Selectivity can arise from differential delay of input signals:
to detect motion from a to e:
- Stagger delays such that a has the longest delay, and e has the shortest delay
- Only fire when the delayed spikes arrive all at once (due to the delays)

MST (medial superior temporal area) neurons respond to more complex motion patterns involving rotation and expansion/contraction
- Counter/Clockwise rotation
- Contracting in / out (think a parallax effect)

Motion processing
- Perceived vs. local motion: Aperture problem
	- Difficult to integrate motion without complete information?
	- **Review**
Barber pole illusion
