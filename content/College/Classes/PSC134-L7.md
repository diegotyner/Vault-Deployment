### Self-Organizing Learning
- Naturally explains learning associations
- What aspects of our learning might be hard to explain in terms of self-organizing learning?
	- Can’t learn to solve challenging problems -- driven by statistics, not error
- $dW = x \cdot y$
	- Just measuring their activity together, purely statistical

Compare to **Error-Driven Learning**
- Error-driven learning drives weight changes as a function of errors: directly tries to fix the problem!
- Delta Rule:
- $dW = x (t-y)$
	- dW = Change in weight
	- t = target activity
	- y = actual activity
	- x = sending unit activity
#### Where does target activity come from?
1) Explicit Teacher - Have a ground truth that's reference. IE getting somebodies name wrong, there is a clear marker for whether you got it right or wrong.
2) Implicit Expectation - Have an expectation for what should be done. IE expectation the word "sure" not to sound like "shore", and then being surprised when your expectation isn't met 
3) Implicit Motor Expectation - Measuring the desired / actual motor outputs / goals. If you throw a ball and it goes off course for example.
4) Implicit Reconstruction - ??
