# 📗 ->  01/06/25: Introduction, Digital Design
---


## 🎤 Vocab



## ❗ Unit and Larger Context
Logisim? - 
Harris Textbook
2 different pdfs: 
1) Kana
2) Stallings

Discussions either lecture, assessment, or review of assessment. 
- If go over mistakes in class, we learn more



## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
- Bridge class between 50 and 154B, next step is important for architecture, but not needed for pure CS. He recommends.
	- Can drive a car with no knowledge of the car. Professional race car drivers will definitely know how it works though. 

### Course Starts:
Start with the basics of the computer
- Need four things
1) Process Data
2) Store Data
3) Move Data
4) Control stuff

Surprisingly, storing data long term is a challenge. 
- Form of storage changes with time, from tapes, to CDs, to floppy disks, hard drives...
	- Especially difficult for long lasting institutions, like Library of Congress that can't afford to migrate everything. 
	- Interesting work at Duke to store information in DNA. Its self repairing? 
		- Super hard to read and write though. Not as big a problem for archives. 

### Circuits
#### Digital
Two distinct states, *high and low*, 1 and 0

#### Analog
No fixed states, varies continuously. Smoooooth representation. 
**Good** at *mathematics* (continuous representation, calculus, area, etc...)
and good at *sound* (music, continuous frequencies)

However, its vulnerable to variations/fluctuations in voltage lead to a different answer. No bueno. 


Future circuits hope to combine them, and use them to cover each others weaknesses. Ensemble. 


### Boolean Algebra
Have:
- *Variables* - A, B, C
- *Operators* - AND, OR, NOT, XOR, NAND
	- Any gates can be made from a **fundamental pair**, like AND, OR, and NOT

*Truth Tables*
In digital boolean shorthand, the circle means you are inverting (NOR) the signal.

| A   | B   | $\bar{A}$ | $\bar{B}$ | $A \land B$ | $A \lor B$ | A XOR B | A NAND B | A NOR B |

| 0   | 1   | 1         | 0         | 0           | 1          | 1       | 1        | 0       |
| 0   | 0   | 1         | 1         | 0           | 0          | 0       | 1        | 1       |
