## 🎤 Vocab



## ❗ Unit and Larger Context
Small summary



## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
### Basic Terminology
G = (V,E)
- V = Set nodes/vertices
- E = Set edges 
---
|V| = n, E=O(n^2)
Dense Graph:  $|E| \approx |V^2|$ 
Sparse Graph:  $|E| \approx |V|$

| Nodes/Vert  | Edges                  |
| ----------- | ---------------------- |
| Cities      | Roads                  |
| Social Netw | Friends                |
| Person      | Interaction of 15 mins |

#### Variants:
- Undirected
- Directed
- Weighted
- X - Multigraph?

#### Adj List / Adj Matrix
int AdjList(n):
	AdjList(i) = All vertices adjaent to i
	- i -> a, all verticies you can walk to from  i, w/ one edge
int AdjMatrix(n)(n):
	A(i)(j) = 1, A connection from i -> j


|          | Adj List                                                              | Adj Matrix |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Lookup   | O(n)                                                                  | O(1)       |
| Space    | O(V+E)                                                                | O(n^2)     |
| Use Case | Sparse graphs<br>- Facebook, most people not connected to whole world | Else       |

BFS
```
Queue G = empty
q.push(s)
while (G is not Empty) {
	u = G.pop
	...
}

```


#### DFS
*Uses*:
- Identify if graph has a cycle (generally bad)
- DFS can tell you which 'task' to start first?
	- Topological sort?
- Helps with building trees in graphs

Input: G(V,E) no source node
Output: Two time stamps for every $v\in V$
```
(1)
	d[v] = time node is first discovered
	f[v] = time node is finished
(2)
	classification of edges into 4 types
	- tree edge. If only focused on tree edges, create a tree graph
	- back edge. Only eists if there is a cycle
	- forward edge. Edge from ancestor to descendants
	(3 and 4 are very similar)
	- cross edge. An edge two trees or subtrees
(3)
// w=white, g=grey, b=black, represen
	DFS_visit(u)
		color[u] = g
		time++
		[u] = time
		for (v in Adj[u]) {
			if (color[v] == w) {
				DFS_visit(v)
			}
		}
		color[u] = b
		time++
		...
		return
```
