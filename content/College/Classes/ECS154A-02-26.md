# üìó Memory and Cache Architecture

---

## üé§ Vocabulary
- **Memory Array:** A linear arrangement of storage cells, often accessed by an address decoder.
- **Decoder:** A circuit that converts binary information from 'n' inputs to a maximum of 2^n unique outputs.
- **Static RAM (SRAM):** Fast, less dense memory used for caches and registers.
- **Dynamic RAM (DRAM):** Slower, denser memory used for main system memory.
- **Cache:** A smaller, faster memory component that stores copies of frequently accessed data.
- **Locality:** The use of relatively close storage locations in space (spatial locality) and time (temporal locality).
- **Direct Mapped Cache:** A cache structure where each block of main memory maps to exactly one cache line.
- **Fully Associative Cache:** A cache structure where any block can be stored in any cache line.
- **Set Associative Cache:** A hybrid cache structure that combines aspects of both direct-mapped and fully associative caches.
- **Replacement Schemes:** Methods for deciding which cache entries to replace, such as Least Recently Used (LRU), Most Recently Used (MRU), Random, etc.

## ‚ùó Context and Significance
- The lecture focused on understanding how computer memory is structured and how caches are used to bridge the speed gap between the CPU and slower main memory.
- **Importance:** Efficient memory access is crucial for optimal CPU performance. Understanding cache design can significantly impact system speed and efficiency.
- **Broader Connections:** This topic connects to concepts in computer architecture, system design, and performance optimization within hardware and software engineering.

## ‚úíÔ∏è Scratch Notes
### Key Definitions and Notes
- Memory: Linear array of storage cells.
- Decoders: Convert address lines into selection signals.
- Address Limitations: Physical constraints limit memory expansion based on address lines.
- SRAM vs. DRAM: SRAM is faster but more expensive and less dense than DRAM.

### Key Processes or Frameworks
- **Cache Design:**
  - **Direct Mapped:** Each memory block maps to one specific cache line.
  - **Fully Associative:** Memory blocks can be placed in any cache line; requires full address comparison.
  - **Set Associative:** Divides the cache into several sets; each set behaves like a small fully associative cache.

- **Locality Principle:**
  - **Spatial Locality:** Access locations are often close together.
  - **Temporal Locality:** Recently accessed locations are likely to be accessed again soon.

## üß† Critical Insights
- **Cache Performance:** Caches exploit locality to reduce memory access times, effectively making memory accesses faster by storing frequently used data.
- **Replacement Strategies:** The choice of replacement strategy can significantly impact cache efficiency and is often chosen based on typical program behavior.
- **Complexity vs. Efficiency:** Fully associative caches provide flexibility but are more complex and expensive to implement than direct-mapped caches.

## ‚ö° Study and Exam Prep
- **Exam Topics:**
  - Understand the trade-offs between SRAM and DRAM.
  - Be able to explain different cache architectures (direct mapped, fully associative, set associative).
  - Discuss the principles of spatial and temporal locality.
- **Challenges:** Understanding how cache replacement strategies work and their implications on performance.

## üîç Applications and Real-World Connections
- **Real-World Relevance:** Cache memories are critical in modern processors, affecting everything from personal computing to large-scale server architectures.
- **Interdisciplinary Links:** Concepts in memory and cache are applicable in fields like software optimization, game design, and real-time systems.
