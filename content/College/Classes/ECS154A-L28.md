Small summary




## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
### Key Characteristics of a memory system
- **Location**:
	- CPU: Registers, cache, etc.
	- Internal: Main mem. 
	- External: Disks, tapes, etc. 
- **Capacity**: 
	- Word size (WS): 
		- Bytes are a fixed 8 bits
		- Word size however varies from machine to machine. Usually the size of an internal register.
- **Unit of transfer**:
		- Number of bytes transferred to/from memory per cycle
		- Related to addressable unit
	- Word
	- Sub-word
	- Block (cache line ex)
		- Line size worth of data
- **Access methods:**
	- *Sequential*
		- Scan through memory until you hit target. 
		- Data laid out sequentially
		- Tape drives!
			- Slow but very dense, make great backups
		- CD more like this
	- *Direct*
		- Go directly to area, then sequential
		- What a regular disk drive does
	- *Random*
		- Go directly to the place that you want.
		- RANDOM access memory (RAM)
	- *Associative*
		- Access based on contents
		- Content Addressable Memories (CAM)
		- Associative Caches, TLBs, etc.
- **Performance**:
	- *Access time*: time to do a read or write
	- *Cycle time*: time *between* operations
	- *Transfer rate*: rate at which data can be transferred in/out of memory. Bandwidth ex.
- **Physical Type**
	- Need 2 (or more) distinct states
	- Semiconductor memory (flip flops / capacitors / etc.)
		- Flash (floating gate)
	- Magnetic surface (tape drives)
	- Optical (optical CDs)
		- Magneto-optical storage?
- **Physical Chars**
	- Volatile (flip flops / capacitors)
	- Non-volatile (Most of the above) - Maintaining memory without power


8x4 Memory Chip:
- 8 entries, 4 bits wide
- always number of entries by number of bits
