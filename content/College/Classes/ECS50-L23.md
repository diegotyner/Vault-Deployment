## ❗ Unit and Larger Context
Small summary



## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
### Wait Loop
- Repeatedly ask I/O device if it has input
- Once it does have input do something with it
- Go back to asking for input
- Disadvantages
	- Keeps the CPU busy asking for input and most of the time input is not available
	- Wasteful of CPU time
- Advantages
	- Simple
	- Low latency: When the input shows up we get it quickly
	- Can all be done in software
#### Wait Loop I/O
On Intel PC, the keyboard data port (KDP) has address 0x60, and its status port (KSP) is at 0x64.
Among other things, the KSP tells us whether a key has been typed yet; Bit 4 will be 1 if so, 0 otherwise.


Can have another type of I/O in place of wait loop (wait loop just polls over and over again looking for input)

### Interrupt Driven I/O
#### Waiting for call analogy:
Waiting for call, so doing something in the meantime. Steps to take from now on are:
1) Pause other task
2) Check the caller ID
3) Take the call
4) Restart the other task
#### Implementation
1) Running some program P
2) I/O device generates an interrupt
3) Save program’s state: EIP, EFLAGS, Seg
4) Ask the I/O device for its interrupt id INTA
	- Acknowledge interrupt
5) I/O device gives back its interrupt Id
6) Service the interrupt
7) Resume program P
	- **IRET**: *I*nterrupt *RET*turn

#### Interrupt Descriptor Table
- OS maintains a table of Interrupt Vectors
- Each vector stores the address of the ISR as well as some other information
	- Protection levels
- Entries are indexed by the interrupt ID of the devices
- Inside of the Intel CPU there is another register called IDT that stores the beginning of the address of the interrupt descriptor table in memory
- OS filled in both the table as well as the register at boot time


#### Where do interrupts happen?
- Interrupts are checked for at the end of every instruction
- CPU Cycle: Fetch, Decode, Execute, Write, Check For Interrupt, Handle interrupt if there is one

> This is the difference between doing doing a math problem and checking your phone between each problem, or doing it until your phone buzzes, then getting to it after you finish your problem.
