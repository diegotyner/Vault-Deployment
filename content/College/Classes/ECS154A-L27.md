#### Control Hazards:
Jumps, If's, generally changing the PC

We can try to address this by *predicting*

**Branch Prediction**
- Need prediction direction
- Need branch target address (BTA)
- Two types:
	1) *Static Prediction* - Do it ahead of time. IE predict a branch will/won't be taken beforehand. Could be helpful for things like looping, where you might have to repeat a lot.
		- 53% accurate
	2) *Dynamic Prediction*
		- Very effective (>90% accurate)
		- Very expensive, more hardware
- *Speculative execution*

3-issue machine, 5-stage pipeline
