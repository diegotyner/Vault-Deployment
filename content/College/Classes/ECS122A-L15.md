## 🎤 Vocab



## ❗ Unit and Larger Context
### Intro Graphs:
- BFS
- DFS
- Prims



## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
$O(E) = E \subseteq |V\cdot V| = n \cdot n$
$|E| \subseteq n^2$

```
# dont know what this is doing?
for (v in V) {
	for (w in V) {
		(v,w)
	}
}


# I think this is vertex edge comboes
for (v in V) {
	for (u in Adj[V]) {
		print(v,w)
	}
}

O(V+E)
```

#### DFS Traversal:
- Topological sort
- Cycles

#### BFS:
- Shortest path given edge weights are unit


> [!warning] GRAPHS ON FINAL
> The big thing on the final will be doing a graph traversal, and marking discovery (d[i]) time and finish (f[i]) time
> 


#### Labeling of Edges
Tree edge transform graph into tree or forest
1) Tree edge = T
2) Back edges = B (*indicate a cycle*)
	- When you have grey to white, that's a tree edge (T)
	- When you have grey to grey, that's a back edge (B) (indicates a cycle)
3) Forward Edge:
	- From ancestor to descendant
		- Grey to black
4) Cross Edge:
	- Between two trees or two subtrees
		- Also grey to black
##### Distinguishing Edges:
- If you have grey to black, that is either a forward edge or a cross edge
	- Time of grey entry ($T_g$) and Time of black entry ($T_b$)
	- REVIEW THIS CAREFULLY. HALF PAYING ATTENTION.
	- If $T_g > T_b$
		- Cross Edge
	- If $T_g < T_b$
		- Forward Edge

### Shortest Path
Input: Weighted graph G(V,E) and W(E)
Output: Arrays D, Pi such that
- $d[u]$ = shortest path from s to u
- $pi[u]=v$ is the ~~predecessor~~ parent of m. Shortest path from s to u. 
Shortest path:
a -- (3) -> b -- (-2) -> c -- (4) -> d

|     | a   | b   | c   | d   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| d   | 0   | 3   | 1   | 5   |
| pi  | 0   | a   | b   | c   |

Prove shortest path problem has optimal substructure for single pair of nodes:
Steps:
1) given: opti is the optimal path / shortest path between u and v
	- Opt = (x1,x2).. Xr. x1 = u, xr=v
2) A = OPT-(x1,x2) 
	- Prove ....e  A is the shortest path from X2 to V in G(v-x1)
3) Assume A is NOT the shortest path in G(v-x1)
=> Then there exists B that is shortest path in G(v-x1) => 
W(B) = W(A) def of optimal/short
B $\cup$ (x1,x2) = VALID path for x1 to V
W(B) + W(x1, x2) < W(A) + W(x1, x2) by alg. 
Valid Path < Optimal, *contradiction*
- W function returns a real value
