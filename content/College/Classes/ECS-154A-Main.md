## üî∂ Course Description
*Introduction to digital design. Interfacing of devices for I/O, memory and memory management. Input/output programming, via wait loops, hardware interrupts and calls to operating system services. Hardware support for operating systems software.*

> My goal in 154A is to teach you more important stuff about computers and how they work.  It's important to know how the machine works, since everything you do in CS eventually winds up running on the hardware, right?  :-)
> We will cover digital design (combinational logic, sequential logic, and how these are used together to build a computer), the basics and a few advanced topics regarding computer design, and then introduce caching and virtual memory.  And if that's not enough, we'll work a few more things in as well.  :-)
> And remember - learn!  I can buy a parrot if I want something to simply repeat what I have said.  Don't be a parrot!  Learn the material, and Demonstrate Understanding.  That should be your goal in all your classes - Learn the material, and Demonstrate Understanding.  If you do that, you will be in great shape.  :-)
