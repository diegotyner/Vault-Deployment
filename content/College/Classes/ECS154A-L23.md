### Cramming before final
[[Virtual-Memory]]


![[ECS154A-L23 2025-03-19 21.27.38.excalidraw]]

Motivation for virtual memory:
- Trying to solve problem of:
- Each process assumes a complete *virtual machine*
- The OS breaks physical memory into something called *frames (page frames)*
- Each process will have a page table, which contains a map of virtual page number to physical frame number
- \[ Virtual Frame Number | Page Number \] => \[ Physical Frame Number | Page Number \] 
	- VF # will be longer than PF #
- Inside the OS, it keeps track of which page tables and processes:
	- Page # -> Process/Owner

##### For Example
![[ECS154A-L23 2025-03-19 21.38.10.excalidraw]]
13 bit VA, 1k byte mem, 64 byte pages
\[ 7 bits | 6 bits\]
- 13 bit VA
How many frames?
- 1k / 64 = 16
How wide is each page table entry?
- 4
How many entries in the page table?
- 2^7


##### New Ex
17 bit address, 16k mem, 512 byte pages
VA: \[   8 bits   | 9 bits\] (out of 17 bit address)
PA:    \[ 5 bits  | 9 bits\] (out of 14 bit address (thats log2(16k) mem))
- How many page table entries?
	- 2^8
- How wide is a page table?
	- 5
- How many frames? 
	- 16k / 512 = 2^14 / 2^9 = 2^5  = 32
- How wide? 
	- 5
##### New Ex
19 bit VA, 32K mem, 1k page
VA: \[   9   | 10\]
PA:       \[ 5 | 10\]

MAPPING FROM VA TO PA KNUCKLEHEAD. THESE ARE EASY
Number of entries in PT?
- 2^9
How wide?
- 5
How many frames?
- 32 (32k/1k)
	- Can use this to get how wide too, SHOULD BE log2(frames)=wide

##### New
32 bit VA, 1M mem, 2k byte
VA: \[ 21 | 11\]
PA:   \[ 9 | 11 \]
^ get by either doing bit assignment, or: 1M/2k = 2^20 / 2^11 = 2^9
> Mapping from 21 bit space to 9 bit space

Number of entries:
- 2^21
Wide?
- 9 bits


How big is our page table? 2^21 x 2 bytes = 2^22 bytes
- Our total memory is 2^10, 2^22 MOGS it
So, we need a base page table, and a secondary page table.
- But now, we can 

#### Page table walk
I don't understand it, but instead of the one page table, you introduce secondary, and event tertiary page table

#### How to implement a cache:
A cache of recent virtual to physical translations

IBM invented this, since they didnt have caches they had lookaside buffers.
They called the translation cache, a *TLB or Translation Lookaside Buffer*

Two Options:
- Send VA to cache, and on miss have TLB check the translation
	- Don't have to go to memory
	- Problem: aliasing, each program has the same VA but not the same PA
- Send 

##### Physically Addressed Cache
CPU <-> TLB <-> Page Table <-> Mem
##### Virtually Addressed Cache
CPU <-> Page Table <-> TLB <-> Mem
