# ðŸ“— -> Handwriting Recognition
---
Lowkey this paper is useless.
Seems like people implemented the easiest way to format letters and gave no thought to whether it would work or not, and edge cases

## 1. Overview  
*Author(s)*: Jayati Ghosh Dastidar, Surabhi Sarkar, Rick Punyadyuti Sinha, Kasturi Basu  
*Date of Publication*: 19 Jul 2015
*Original Publication/Source*: [Link to the project](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/handwriting-recognition)

## 2. Project Summary
>This paper describes the method to recognize offline handwritten characters. A robust algorithm for handwriting segmentation is described here with the help of which individual characters can be segmented from a selected word from a paragraph of handwritten text image which is given as input.

### Domain: 
[[ECS-174-Main|Computer Vision]]

## 3. Methodology
Describe the methods and techniques used in the project.

- *Experimental Setup*:
  - *Data Collection*: 
  - *Processing Pipeline*: 
![[Handwiring-Processing-Pipeline.png]]
#### Data Preprocessing and Image Extraction
Input images are cursive handwriting
Images are filtered to obtain the best representation for each word
- What the hell does this mean? Do they go over by hand and pick a word that 'looks good'??
RBG -> Grayscale
Grayscale -> Binary
Objects too small (<15 pixels) are removed
#### Line recognition
When the sum of an entire rows black pixels is zero (ie no writing on a row), consider it a line break
#### Letter Extraction
When the vertical sum of the row is zero, consider it a break
#### Letter identification
Compare it to a database of numbers and letters, and identify it as the one where the correlation coefficient is the highest
