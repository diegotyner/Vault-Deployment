## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
*Localism* - Higher fucntions are localized in different centers of the brain, mainly the cortex. aka *Localizationism*
- Gall
- Broca
- Brodmann
- Cajal
*Holism* - The brain works as a whole, unified mind
- Freud
- Flourens
- Golgi

*Franz Gall* - "Faculty" Psychology
- 1758-1828
- Several innate abilities exist
- Impossible to reduce these abilities, and they are independent
- "27" human abilities, localized in specific regions of the brain
	- These abilities are reflected in the shape of the skull
Proponent of **Phrenology**

*Pierre Flourens* - Holist
- 1794-1967
- "Cortex had to work as a unified whole"
- Would run "pithing" experiment where he would drive a needle into a pigeons brain and observe behavior afterwards. 
- Concluded:
	- Unified mind
	- Cerebrum - seat of intelligence
	- Cerebelum - control of locomotion
	- Medulla oblongata - seat of the principle of life
- Proponent of the aggregate field theory, whole brain participates in behavior

*Camillo Golgi*
- (1843-1926)
- Developed a method for staining nerves
	- Suggested nervous system was one large interconnected network (shared cytoplasm) "syncytium"
*Santiago Ramon y Cajal*
- (1852-1934)
- Used staining to discover single neurons
- *Seperate* processing units
Golgi & Cajal: co-winners Nobel prize winners 1906

##### Different Types of Neurons:
- Multipolar neuron: one of the most common
- Bipolar neuron: Very rare, but are transmitters in our eyes
- Unipolar neuron: most of the sensory neurons in our body
- Anaxonic Neuron: Found in our brain, not super understood

Afferent transmits towards brain
Efferent: Move away from center, like towards motor neurons
- Effector neurons
Interneurons too

**SAME** Pneuomic:
- *S*ensory is *A*fferent, *M*otor is *E*fferent 

#### Basic Components
- Axon hillock, sends electrical signal down axon to terminal butons.
	- Transmits nerve impulse
- Myelin sheaths, nodes of Ranvier
	- White matter is fatty myelin. White matter tracts.
MS is a demyelinating disease
- Autoimmune disorder, body starts attacking myelin and slowing down signals.
	- May develop motor problems because neurons not firing quick enough to be synchronous
