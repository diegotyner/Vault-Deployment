- A nMOS pulls to ground when activated. Active high.
- A pMOS pulls to ground when NOT activated. Active low.

Once the gate (G) is greater than threshold voltage ($V_{th}$) then the gate will form a path between the two, and the device will be on.

- As shown in class, NOT gate
- Resistor shown above in the squiggly.
	- But, the resistor is expensive to make, so instead we use a gate on top.
