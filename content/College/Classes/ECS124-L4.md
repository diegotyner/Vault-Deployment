## ‚ùó Unit and Larger Context
### Covered optimal alignment last time
$OPT(i,j) =$ max alignment score for sequences
- $s1[1...i]$ and $s1[1...j]$
$$
\displaylines{
= max[score(n,m) + OPT(n-1, m-1),\\ 
score(n, \_) + OPT(n-1, m), \\
score(\_, m) + OPT(n, m-1)]
}
$$

Visualized as a traceback array:

| $OPT(i-1, j-1)$<br>Use letter i, j for match | $OPT(i-1, j)$<br>Space against char i |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| $OPT(i, j-1)$<br>Space against char j        | $OPT(i, j)$                           |


|     | 0   | 1   | 2            | 3   |
| --- | --- | --- | ------------ | --- |
| 0   | <-- | <-- | /\\<br> \|   |     |
| 1   |     |     | /\\<br> \|   |     |
| 2   |     |     | \|\\<br>  \\ |     |
| 3   |     |     |              | X   |
This traceback array indicates the following optimal alignment:
- ---      ---    x(1)    x(2)    x(3)
- y(1)    y(2)    ---     ---     y(3)


## ‚úíÔ∏è -> Scratch Notes
*Local Alignment*: Goal is to find a single similar region
*Global Alignment*: Find the optimal alignment to maximize total matching
