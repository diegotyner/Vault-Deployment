### Cramming


Decoder to memory: N -> 2^N

2 kinds of volatile mmeory
- Static + Dynamic
	- Static is FF
		- Cross coupled NOT 
	- Dynamic is transistors
		- k
		- Very small, bucket of electrons
		- Reading, dump onto word line bus

SRAM:
- Hot
- Fast
- Not dense
SRAM:
- Cool
- Slow
- Dense

Cache:
- Write into memory address register
- Clarify read or write
