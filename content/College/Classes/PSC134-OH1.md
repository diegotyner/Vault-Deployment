# 📗 -> 9/27: Hippocampus Question

## ❗ Information
Went up after class to Alan (alanzacyc@gmail.com) to ask about how the [[Hippocampus|hippocampus]] activates a memory. He said it's a large area of study, but it's not as simply as any one place picking a memory. Even if you have one major $f(x)$  in charge of mapping it, you will have other noise, and there is intrinsic variance in memory activated as well.

I asked him for leads, and he mentioned:
- Entorhinal cortex, which has links with the hippocampus in memory activation (and consolidation). He mentioned that this area is a major pathway into the hippocampus
- Memory Activation
- some more i'm forgetting


He also mentioned his own work, working with PyTorch and (something else?) to create models. He mentioned an entorhinal cortex project, a RL agent that performs in an environment somewhat like Minecraft (something about agent crafting?).

Seemed to hint at wanting to work together, definitely encouraged me to reach out.
