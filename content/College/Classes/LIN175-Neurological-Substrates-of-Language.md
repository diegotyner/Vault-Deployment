	- Dark Orange: *Wernicke's Area*. BA22

##### Wernicke's Location
"Wernicke's area lies in the posterior superior temporal gyrus near the caudal end of the Sylvian fissure, spanning the planum temporale, BA40 and area Tpt (Falk, 2007). Area Tpt is analogous with the posterior end of BA22 (Galaburda and Sanides, 1980) and comprises a portion of cortex underlying the planum temporale (Spocter et al. 2010)." - [src](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/wernickes-area)
