### Dopamine Bursts
> Why do our happiness levels not change that much, even after winning the lottery, or after becoming paralyzed?

![[Dopamine-With-Conditioned-Stimulus.png|300]]
- Dopamine can be associated with a conditioned stimulus (**CS**), and be abstracted away from the reward. The dopamine burst will instead signal the deviation from our expectations.
#### Rescorla-Wagner / Delta Rule
$\delta = r - \hat r$
$\delta = r - \sum x w$
#### But does not explain CS-onset firing  
– need to anticipate the future!
$\delta = (r + f) - \hat r$
CS-onset = future reward = f

$f = \gamma \hat V(t+1)$ <- Future expectation. Gamma ($\gamma$) is a discount factor
