## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
Can prove by contradiction:

### Reqs for Proof
In order to prove a greedy algo, need to prove:
1) Greedy first choice
2) Suboptimality
They are not equivalent, can have one without the other

For dynamic programming:
1) Only suboptimality needed


### 
#### Step 1
Given opt solution to knapsack
$OPT = \{x_1, \dots, x_n\}$
OPT <= set items such that value is maximized and weight is valid
#### Step 2: 
A = OPT - {x1}
Prove A is optimal for items S-{x1} with a bag capacity W-w\[x_i\]
#### Step 3:
Assume A is not optimal for S-{x1}
rev(B) > rev(A) by def optimality
Bu{x1} fits into nag W 
rev(B) + V\[x1\] > rev(A) + V\[x1\]
strategy > rev(OPT) => *contradiction*
