### Submitting Reading Reactions:
Reactions need to include:
1) Big picture: general reaction
> Did you generally find the overall content understandable or compelling or relevant or not, and why, or which aspects of the reading were most novel or challenging for you and which aspects were most familiar or straightforward?)  
2) Specifics: specific reaction to one aspect of the reading
> Did a specific aspect of the reading raise questions for you or relate to other ideas and findings you’ve encountered, or are there other related issues you wish had been covered?)
