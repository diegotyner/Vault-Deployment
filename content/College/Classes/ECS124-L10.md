## 🎤 Vocab



## ❗ Unit and Larger Context
- Alignment
- BLAST
- Reference genome search - i.e. suffix tree
	- Genome assembly
- Started covering De Novo assembly (no reference genome)
- Cycles
	- Eulers Path
	- Hamiltonian path



## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
### Sanger Sequencing via Scaffolding
Hamiltonian cycle instead reads - use k-mers of length 3: path that visits each node only once returns to the starts

| R1  | ATGGCGT |     | K-mers |     | Connections with `K-mers[1:]` |
| --- | ------- | --- | ------ | --- | ----------------------------- |

> An Euler path is a path that passes through every edge exactly once. If it ends at the initial vertex then it is an Euler cycle.
> A Hamiltonian path is a path that passes through every vertex exactly once (NOT every edge). If it ends at the initial vertex then it is a Hamiltonian cycle.

### Machine Learning / Classification
Classify a region as coding or non coding, and annotate it in some way 

#### Starting with Naive Bayes
Patient tests high protein. 
$P(Cancer | \uparrow Protein) = \frac{P(Cancer  \land \uparrow Protein)}{P(\uparrow Protein)}$

| $\uparrow$ C   | .8  |     | $\uparrow$ P   | .25 |
| -------------- | --- | --- | -------------- | --- |
| $\downarrow$ C | .2  |     | $\downarrow$ P | .75 |
$P(C\land \uparrow P) = \frac{P(\uparrow P \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(\uparrow P)}$

$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\land B)}{P(B)}$
$P(Class \mid Feature) = \frac{P(Feature\mid Class)\cdot P(Class)}{P(Feature)}$
$P(Feature) = P(Feature \land Class) + P(Feature \land \lnot Class)$
