## 🎤 Vocab



## ❗ Unit and Larger Context
Spent time learning about visual system, now we move onto audition! 

### Refresher
vision:
- Light enters retina
- Photoreceptors there
- Maps to thalamus
- Then to primary visual cortex
We've noticed the mapping, the sensory epithelium
- Retinotopic map



## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
**Slideshow 1**
### Audition
Step 1: Transducing sound in the inner ear
... **Review**
Traveling waves along the *basilar membrane* primarily excite hair cells at a frequency-specific location:
- Low frequency closer to the tip
- High frequency closer to the oval window
- Mixture of frequencies wil excite along multiple parts of the membrane

Cochlear hair cells are tuned to a frequency:
- At their preferred frequency, you need a much lower magnitude of sound to excite them
- Selective place coding

Transmission steps:
- Ear
	- The outer ear alters the effective sound spectrum depending on sound location. This allows for vertical perception of sound later on
- cochlear nuclei
- Superior olivary nuclei
	- First step to combine ears
	- Delay between time in both ears (inter-aural time difference, ITD) is used for horizontal position here
	- The ITD is calculated by coincidence detectors, where the place where sound from each ear arrives together is their ITD, "Delay Lines"
- Inferior colliculus
- Thalamus
- Auditory cortex

	- Difference in loudness (inter-aural intensitiy/level/loudness, ILD) is used here. 

#### Primate Auditory Cortex
We see a similar division of processing as visual system (The what/where division in ventral/dorsal processing streams) 
- The "where" pathways meet in parietal lobe, PPC (posterior parietal cortex)
- The "what" pathways meet in temporal lobe


Primate Auditory cortex shows Tonotopic Map
- Auditory fields organized according to tonotopy (frequencies of sounds they respond to)

#### Cortical Responses to Sound Stimuli
Similar to noise variability in visual cortex, we see large variability in spiking in auditory system. Similar to a Poisson distribution.

Sensory Systems – Feedback, Predictive Coding, Anticipating sensory consequences of own actions

### Predictive Coding
Traditionally, hierachical processing is thought as feed-forward
- $V1 \to V2 \to V3$
However, in reality they are bideractional
- $V1 \iff V2 \iff V4$

What gives? What is transmitted backwards? What does this do for sensory signals?
This gives rise to *Predictive Coding*

Each higher level is continuosly making prediction, and using the signals it receives from prior levels as a feedforward error signal. It then sends back predictions as feedback
- *Forwarding*: Not the representation of the lower level explicitly but only in what way this representation deviates from the predicton provided by the higher level
- *Feedback*: Used to send a prediction of expected features to the lower level based on the current representation at the higher level
In a hierarchical context:
- Lower level explanations explain what they can, and if they can't figure it out send the signals to a higher level that might be able to piece the clues together.
*This is a continuous flow of information, forward signals and feedback are continuously updated*

### Discussion
Convergence:
- Multiple types:
	- Convergence over space: Allows for processing over a spread out area, however loses spatial resolution
	- Convergence over time: Maintains spatial resolution, but loses temporal resolution (needs to be averaged first)
	- Could potentially combine through different processing pathways

Parallel processing:
- Examples
	- The obvious example is what/where ventral/dorsal pathways.
	- Columns in V1
	- ITD/ILD
	- Broadband/color specific sensing
- Benefits
	- Minimizes energy
	- Allows to combine benefits/minimize weaknesses of different approaches
	- Specializations

Disparity:
- Zero-disparity:
	- Map the left eye zero to right eye zero. Coincidence detector
- Particular Positive or Negative Disparity:
	- Coincidence detector with an offset. (-2, 0), (-1, 1), (0, 2), etc.
- Near tuned or far tuned neuron
	- Higher level neuron that takes input from sets of disparity tuned neurons, and fires when any of their selective group fires (fires when the +1 disparity, or the +2 or +3 fires)
	- Build something simple, and combine together to build something more complex
	- Not the only way to do it, but one way
