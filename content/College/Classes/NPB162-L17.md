## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
### Spatial maps in the hippocampus: 
- place cells

> Abrupt phase transition between square-
like and circle-like representations in
intermediate octagonal environments.

Place cells are not metric - they do not preserve distances

#### Types of Remapping:
1) Rate Remapping 
2) Global Remapping
3) Space deformation
![[Navigation-Types-of-Remapping.png|400]]


Not just space information:
- Place cells can fire in anticipation of a turn in a given maze
- "Neurons that fire when rat is planning to turn left, instead of right. Encode some form of behavioral intention"

### Spatial maps outside the hippocampus:
- grid cells, head-direction cells, border cells

*Head Direction Cells:*
- Navigation requires both a map of space and a compass to tell direction
- Head direction specific cells discovered James Ranck (1984) in dorsal presubiculum (also called postsubiculum)
- They remap, but they remap together (in relation to each other)

*Time Cells:*
- More complicated experiment, multiple designs/controls
- Find neurons responsive to time

*Speed Cells:*
- Most complicated experiment: Put rats in a little car, and see their neural response
- Find neurons responsive to running speed of car.

*Grid Cells:*
- Hexagonal coding of position
- Aligned to environment specific landmarks (same as place cells)
