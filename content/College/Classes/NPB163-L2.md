## ❗ Unit and Larger Context
Small summary




## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
### Practice:
How to:
- Extracellular recording?
	- Electrode
- Intracellular recording?
	- Insert a --
	- Patch clamp, seal the membrane
	- What do we measure?
		- Membrane potential
		- EPSP / IPSP
- ECoG / iEEG
	- Electrode grid placed on the surface of the brain
	- Measures population activity
- Optical Imaging
	- There is intrinsic / voltage sensitive dye / calcium sensitive dye
		- Intrinsic - Measure reflectance of the light, measure oxygen consumption of area
		- Indirect measure of activity

### Today's Class - Non-invasive
EEG / MEG / fMRI

#### EEG
Noninvasive measure popular in cognitive neuroscience
EEG signal is an aggregate signal that has been heavily filtered (volume conduction, skull); localizing the source of a signal component is difficult; temporal resolution is good

*How?*
- Positive charge gets into dendrites, leaves negative charge outside
	- Creates a dipole:
		- Positive on cell body
		- Negative on cell dendritic synaptic terminals

EEG is primarily used to measure either evoked potentials or oscillatory activity at various frequencies


#### MEG
- On top of measuring electric field, we can measure the magnetic field. 
- With MEG, we measure the magnetic field around the head generated by eletric activity in the brain
- Less popular than EEG due to its equipment (expensive, bulky)
- Better spatial resolution than EEG, magnetic field less distorted by skull and scal than the electric field

> [!tip] Apparently there's a lot of online resources about MEG data? 


#### fMRI
- fMRI is probably the most popular technique for noninvasively measuring neural actvity in - cognitive neuroscience.
- It is an indirect measurement of neural activity, providing a Blood Oxygenated Level Dependency - (BOLD) signal

> - A strong static magnetic field (B0) is used to align spins (of, e.g., protons in water or fat in body tissue). 
> - A radiofrequency (RF) magnetic field (B1) causes spins to flip (transient loss of alignment with B0 field) and to phase-synchronize. 
> - Signals resulting from the realignment of the spins with the B0 field and from phase desynchronization are measured. 
> - Gradient fields are used to make the measurement spatially selective

T1 and T2 components:
- T1 spin-lattice relaxation time?
	- Used for anatomic imaging
- T2 spin-spin relaxation time?
	- More measuring how synchronized different protons are
> 	- important component for fMRI; measurement of local field inhomogeneities resulting from the paramagnetic properties of deoxyhemoglobin

Time delay:
![[Hemdynamic-Response-Function.png|400]]
- Intrinsic imaging will analyze the initial dip, while fMRI will measure the hemodynamic peak
- Also be careful of what we are actually measuring:
	- BOLD correlates with energy demanding activity. This is not necessarily spiking activity.
	- *Strongly influenced by dendritic activity*


> [!NOTE] Check the lecture slides 40-41 for technique tables. Very helpful


### Interpreting Neural Activity
We cannot assume causation, merely correlation a lot of the time.
Easy example:
- Knee reflex:
	- You'll see activation in both somatosensory cortex, and the reflex.
	- However, they are not linked. It is the sensory nerve that invigorates both. This causes linked/correlated activity, but no causal connection.

Establishing a causal relationship requires *manipulation* of neural activity.
- Traditionally, this was done through *lesion studies*.
	- Phineas Gage e.x.
	- They used his lesion to link the prefrontal cortex to self control.
- However, waiting for specific patients is infeasable.

*Experimental Lesions:*
- Advantage of being able to define location of lesion
- Options to do it surgically or chemically
- However, irreversible
*Reversible Inactivation:*
- Allow study of before / during / and after inactivation.
- Possible chemically
- Possible with an implanted cooling device (cooling chip / cryoloop)

### More Stim

#### Microstimulation
**REVIEW**
#### Optogenetic Stimulation
Introduce molecules that can be light-activated into the cell membrane in order to depolarize or hyerpolarize the neuron
- Channels for both:
	- Depolarization (light gated leak channel)
		- Channelrhodopsins
	- Hyperpolarization (active pumps)
		- Halorhodopsins
		- Archaerhodopsins
Typically done by creating transgenic animals or viral-based gene delivery

> The advantage of optogenetics is that specific cells can be genetically targeted such that only a particular type of neurons is affected by the stimulation
> The disadvantage is with viral-based delivery, the viruses used as vectors have their own cell specificity




## Questions?
- [X] Review optical imaging
- [ ] What is T3 measuring?
	1. Hell whats is T2 measuring
