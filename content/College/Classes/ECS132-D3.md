### R Code to Simulate



### HW
#### Problem 5
2 flashlights, type 1 and type 2.
Type 1 gives more than 100 hours of use with P=0.4
Type 2 gives more than 100 hours of use with P=0.5
25% of flashlights in a bin are Type 1

If you use a flashlight that lasts more than 100 hours, what probability is it that it is type 2?

**CHECK WORK WITH DISCUSSION FILES**
$$
\displaylines{
P(>100hrs|T1) = 0.4 \\
P(>100hrs|T2) = 0.5 \\
P(T1) = 0.25 => P(T2) = 0.75 \\
P(T2 | >100hrs) = \frac{P(T2 \,\cap\, >100hrs )}{P(>100hrs)} \\
P(>100hrs) = P(T1 \,\cap\, >100hrs ) + P(T2 \,\cap\, >100hrs ) \\
= P( >100hrs | T1)\cdot P(T1) + P(>100hrs |  T2)P(T2) \\
= 0.4 \cdot 0.25 + 0.5 \cdot 0.75 \\
P(T2) = P(>100hrs |  T2)P(T2) = 0.5 \cdot 0.75 \\ 
P(T2 | >100hrs) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.75}{0.4 \cdot 0.25 + 0.5 \cdot 0.75}
}
