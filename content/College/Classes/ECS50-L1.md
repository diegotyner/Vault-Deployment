## ❗ Unit and Larger Context
Small summary

## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
- Everything is bits
- Mapping of bits to meaning is artificial, and up to programmers
	- B bits can represent $2^B$ unique items
	- If you have S unique states you need $\lceil{}log_2(S)\rceil$  bits
		- Or the first power of 2 $\geq$ than S
Int 4 bytes/32 bits
Short 2 bytes/16 bits
Char 1 byte/8 bits
Float 4 bytes/32 bits
Double 8 bytes/64 bits
Sizes of variables can vary across systems so if you ever need to know a variables size in bytes keep using sizeof()
