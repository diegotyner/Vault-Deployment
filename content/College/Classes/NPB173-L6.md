## ❗ Unit and Larger Context
### Review Up Until Now
#### Lecture 1: Overview
- Impact of brain disorders
	- variety of levels of severity for and across disorders
	- Not just the person, but the radius of impact on people around them
- Studying brain disorders from the complementary perspectives of neurology and psychiatry
	- Psychiatric - Always involving the brain
	- Neurological - Not always about the brain. Spinal injury, etc.
- Characterizing signs and symptoms of dysfunction to reach a diagnosis
	- Symptom - 1st person
	- Sign - 3rd person objective measure
	- Diagnosis - A word/classification that can describe a disorder
- Pathophysiology
	- What has gone awry in biological processes to underlie a particular disorder
- Connecting across multiple spatial scales/levels of analysis of the nervous system
	- Familiar with terms across different levels
- Changing perspectives from diseased brain to healthy brain as a goal
- Use of model systems to better understand brain disorders
	- Use of animal model and non-human model systems
	- In vitro and in vivo, both beneficial
#### Lecture 2:
- Basic function of neurons and glia
	- Astrocytes play a role in the BBB, and other roles as well (glial scar formation too)
	- Oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells provide myelin
- Large scale division of the nervous system
	- CNS vs PNS. Implications for brain function
	- Difference in myelin providing cells, and BBB
	- Subdivision in CNS:
		- Cerebrum, thalamus, diencephalon, cerebellum, brain stem, spinal cord
- Segmented structure of the spinal cord
	- Segmented structure of the spinal cord
	- Major segments in the SC that correspond to different spinal nerves. 
	- Dermatomes for sensory system, myotomes for the motor system
- Grey matter vs white matter
	- Grey matter on inside of the spinal cord (butterfly like)
		- Where cell bodies reside (everything else too ofc)
	- White matter consists almost entirely of axon bundles (outside of spinal cord)
		- Need to know 3 tracts
- Dermatomes reveal vertical organization of spinal cord
- Dorsal/ventral (back/bely) organization of the spinal cord
	- Rostral/Caudal
- Wallerian degeneration
	- Biological response to injury. Active degeneration
	- Kind of like a scab. Useful
- Axonal regeneration and differences between PNS and CNS
	- Only the PNS can recover axon with proper route finding
	- Not hard to regrow growth cone, but finding proper route can be hard. Schwann cells can guide this, form hollow tubes along path. (can be hard for long axons though)
- Deductive approach for inferring spinal injury based on symptoms and vice-versa
