### Representation of Vision in the Retina
**Receptive Field** - Area of vision that elicits a response in the cell
- Usually center surround

Light hyperpolarizes **photoreceptors**
Signal transmits through **bipolar cells** to **retinal ganglion cells (RGC)** transmit to the brain

*RGCs*: On-center / off-surround
- Maximal when light only in center, dark outside
- Baseline when fully dark or fully light
- Minimal when light outside, dark inside

*Bipolar Cells*:
- Two types, on and off
- Off preserve the sign of the cone, hyperpolarized by light
- On reverse the sign of the cone, depolarized by light

*Horizontal Cells*:
- Connect to surrounding cones, and can provide lateral connections
- Provides feedback to multiple cones
