## 🎤 Vocab


## ❗ Unit and Larger Context
Covering mostly voltage and current



## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes

$$V_m = \sum_i^{e, i, l} \frac{g_j}{g_e + g_i + g_l}E_j$$
Saying that the voltage is the sum of the current divided by its fraction of net current, times its driving force

$$
\displaylines{ g_e = \bar g_e g_e(t) \\
\bar g_e = \text{max conductance with all channels open} \\
g_e(t) = \text{dynamic proportion of channels open}
}
$$



### The Synapse:

### Rate Code:
Brain likes spikes, but rates are great!  
- Instantaneous and steady – smaller, faster models  
- But definitely lose several important things  
- Solution: do it both ways, and compare  

Goal: equation that makes good approx of  actual spiking rate for same sets of inputs


## 🧪-> Example
- List examples of where entry contents can fit in a larger context
