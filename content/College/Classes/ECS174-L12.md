### Important Functions for Architecture:
#### Normalization
**Soft max:**
$P(c_i|x)=y_i = \frac{exp(x_i)}{\sum ^n _{j=1}exp(x_j)}$
#### Loss
**Loss**: Comparing ground truth with the output: $L(x,y,w) = \sum^n _{i=1} -gt(i)log(P(c_i|x))$
If we're assuming one hit encoding, we can make the following step:

**Loss** *assuming one-hot encoding* for ground truth: $L(x,y,w) = -log(P(c_y|x))$

**Loss** for a *mini-batch* of size N: $L=\sum^N_{k=1} -log(P(c_{y_k} |x_k))$

### Visualizing CNNs
[Cool article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.2901v3)
Allegories to visual system, layers have more complicated features as you go on
Big ties to *explainable AI*, there is great value in being able to see what the network is doing under the hood
Strategies for visualizing:
- Visualizing weights, this is very useful for lower level filter extracting physical features. A good use case for this is *edge detection*
- Visualizing responsiveness. As you get higher leveled, the weights become harder to interpret as they respond to latent features and not direct image qualities. To address this, show each neurons most responsive images. This is done by showing top 9 images

#### Layer 1
- Simple features, similar to V1 in the brain
**Filters** in bottom right, **Top-9** shown large

### Vanishing Gradient Problem
Using gradient descent:
- If one of the layers produces zero (or near zero) gradient, because we multiply the loss together, it will eliminate the gradients in the other layers as well
- Particularly a problem in deep learning, where more layers introduces more possibilities of this happening
