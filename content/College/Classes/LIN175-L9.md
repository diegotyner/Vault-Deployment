### Double Dissociation Between Knowledge of English Prepositions and Performance on a Variety of Visuospatial Tasks
Tranel 2000 - [Link](https://doi.org/10.1080/026432900410766)

#### Method
1. Guess angle alignment 
2. Deconstruct an object then reconstruct it
3. Asked to replicate images from multi-view schematics
4. 3D object recognition task (rotate and view if matching)
#### Subjects
Two lesion patients,1978JB (53F) and 1688PG (53M)

Found a double dissociation between performance on preposition tasks and visuospatial tasks for the two subjects. Attributed to lesions affecting responsible brain regions, and that the pathways are neurologically distinct.
