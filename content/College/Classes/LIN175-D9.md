Patient:
- 45 year old man with ALS, symptoms 5 years before study
- ALS Functional Rating Scale–Revised score of 23 (range 0-48, higher better)
- modified Mini–Mental State Examination score of 27 (scores range from 0 to 27, with higher scores being consistent with better cognitive function)
- Communication:
	- When speaking to expert listeners, he communicated at a mean (±SD) rate of 6.8±5.6 correct words per minute (the rate of conversational English is approximately 160 words per minute)
	- Mean typing: 6.3±1.3 correct words per minute

Paper:
