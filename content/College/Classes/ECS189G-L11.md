## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
### Variational Auto-Enconders (VAE)
Less similar to the previous auto-encoder variants
Based on: Bayesian ad Graphical Model
- Prior likelihood $p_\theta(z)$
- Likehood $p_\theta(x|z)$
- Posterior Likelihood: $p_\theta(z|x)$
> x is the image
> z is the embedding of the image

How do we generate a data instance $x^i$ that looks real. Assume that we know the rel parameter $\theta^*$ for the distributions
- Sample a $z^i$ from a prior distribution $p_{0^*}(z)$
- Generate a value $x^i$ from a conditional distribution $p_{\theta^*}(x|z=z^i)$

#### Distribution parameter learning
**Review**
what?

#### Common Arches:
Img -> VAE encoder -> UNet -> VAE Decoder -> img
Text  ->  CLIP ?         ->  /\

### CNN
Image representation:
- Black/White Image Matrix (1 or 0 matrix)
- Gray image Matrix (1 byte per pixel)
- Color Image Tensor  (3 matrices, 1 byte for Red/Green/Blue)

Weakness of MLPs for 3 color images:
- Insufficient for CV taks
- Too many parameters to learn
	- Input layer size for image of size m\*n would be 3mn for color images
	- With more hidden layers to learn, even more to consider
- Discards spatial information, all into one vector of independent elements
	- Assumes everything is *iid* (independent and identically distributed)

#### Common Image Processing Operators
- Gaussian Blur
- Sobel Operator (edge detection, look up sobel matrices)
- Canny Edge Detector (edge detection thinning edges)

- Image Blur
	- Define a kernel, and apply to image A:
$$
\text{Box Blur: }
G = \frac{1}{9}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 1 
\end{bmatrix} 
* A
$$
Guassian Blur:
- $\Gamma (x,y) = \frac{1}{2\pi \sigma^2} exp^{- \frac{x^2+y^2}{2\sigma^2}}$
Sobel Operator:
$$
\displaylines{
G_x = 
\begin{bmatrix}
+1 & 0 & -1 \\
+2 & 0 & -2 \\
+1 & 0 & -1 
\end{bmatrix} 
* A \\
\\
G_y 
\begin{bmatrix}
+1 & +2 & +1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
-1 & -2 & -1 
\end{bmatrix} 
* A \\
\\
G = \sqrt{G_x^2 + G_y^2}
}
$$
#### Convolution
> Convolution Mathematical Definition

An operator defined for two functions f(t) and g(t)
$f(t) * g(t) := \sum^{\infty}_{-\infty} f(x)g(t-x)dx$
