## ❗ Unit and Larger Context
### Naive Probability Continued
Naive Definition: $P(A) = \frac{|A|}{|S|}$
- Not applicable in the cases that:
	- Not all events are equally likely
	- Sample space is infinite

### *Critical* Naive Bayes Formulas:
P(Class | Feature) = P(Class and Feature) / P(Feature)
P(Feature) =  P(Feature and Class) + P(Feature and Not Class)



## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
Sample space is heads out of 2 flips
Naive probability would lead you to believe that all outcomes are equally likely, and P(1 head) = 1/3. In reality, its 1/2.


$$
\displaylines{
P(A^c) = P(\bar A) = |S| - |A| = 1 - P(A) \\
P(A \;and\; B) = P(A | B)\,P(B) = P(B | A)\,P(A) \\
P(A \;or\; B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \;and\; B) \\
P(A \;and\; B) = P(A) \;\; \text{  if A \& B are independent} \\
P(A \;and\; B) = P(A)\,P(B) \;\;\text{ if A \& B are independent}
}
$$
### Worked Example
If you roll 2 dice: 
Number rolled on first dice is x, on 2nd is y
Find P(x=2 | x + y = 8) = |A | B| / |B| = 1/36 / 5/36 = 1/5
Find P(x + y = 8 | x=2) = |B | A| / |A| = 1/36 / 1/6 = 1/6

### Naive Bayes
Patient tests for cancer
P(Cancer | High Protein) = P(Cancer and High Protein) / P(High Protein)
P(HP) = P(HP & C) + P(HP & not C)
Sample 1000 that have cancer:

Given: Cancer 

|     | HP  | ~HP |
| --- | --- | --- |
| C   | .8  | .2  |
| ~C  | .1  | .9  |
> Given: P(~C) = .01
 
P(HP and C) = P(HP | C) * P(C)
P(HP & ~C) = P(HP | ~C) * P(~C)



### Naive Bayes:
P(Class | Feature) = P(Class and Feature) / P(Feature)
P(Feature) =  P(Feature and Class) + P(Feature and Not Class)


Given: Covid

|      | POS | NEG |
| ---- | --- | --- |
| COV  |     |     |
| ~COV |     |     |
P(COV | NEG) = P(COV and NEG) / P(NEG)
P(NEG) = P(NEG and C) P(NEG and ~C)

P(NEG and C) = P(NEG | C) P(C) = .01 x .15

P(NEG and ~C) = P(NEG | ~C) P(~C) = .9 x .85w
