## ❗ Unit and Larger Context
Small summary



## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
### Object Detection
#### single Object?
-> Treat localization as a regression problem!

#### Multiple Objects?
- Each image needs a different number of outputs
-> Apply a CNN to many different crops of the image, CNN classifies each crop as object 
or background

#### Region Selection
In order to not have to do a CNN for a massive amount of potential crops (for multiple object search)...
-> find "blobby" regions likely to contain objects

### R-CNN
Make CNN do roposas 
Region Proposal Network (RPN) to redict proposals from features


- Otherwise same as Fast R-CNN
	- Crop features for each proposal, classify each one
	- Basically train a classifier to detect object

**Bipartite**: 2 sets of N objects, cost between association object i to j has a cost. 
- **Stable Marriage**: Each object in each set tied to 1 and only one 1 object in the other set
	- Find the marriage that minimizes cost, make it *stable*
	- Solution to this is the **hungarian algorithm**, O(n)

R-CNN Benchmarks for Test-Time Speed: 
- R-CNN: 49
- SPP-Net: 4.3
- Fast R-CNN: 2.3
- Faster R-CNN: 0.2

#### Single-Stage Object Detectors: YOLO / SSD / RetinaNet
 Input image
 - 3 x H x W
 Divide image into grid
 - 7 x 7
- Image a set of base boxes centered at each grid cell
	 - Here B = 3
 Within each grid cell:
- Regress from each of the B base boxes to a final box with 5 numbers:
	- (dx, dy, dh, dw, confidence)
- Predict scores for each of C classes (including background as a class)
- Looks a lot like RPN, but category-specific!
Output:
- 7 x 7 x (5 * B + C

Mask R-CNN (looks to identify something and give a mask outline (countour kind of))
Also does pose

#### Object Detection + Captioning = Dense Captioning
![[Dense-Captioning.png]]
- Can extrapolate out to do dense *video* captioning
#### Objects + Relationships = Scene Graphs
- Captures relationships between objects
	- Painting is hanging on a wall
		- Painting -> Hanging -> Wall
	- Very useful for robotics
