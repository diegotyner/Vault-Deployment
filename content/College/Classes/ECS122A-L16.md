## 🎤 Vocab



## ❗ Unit and Larger Context
Shortest path prob has optimal substructure
### Facts
- Paths w more than |v| -1 edges have cycles
- If path/graph has a negative cycle => shortest path problem is undefined
	- Can just take cycle infinitely and continue lowering weight
Opt(n-1, V) = shortest path from S to V using at most n-1 edges
= min(  OPT(n-2,V), (w(u, v) +OPT(n-2, u)) )
- Add edge or don't
