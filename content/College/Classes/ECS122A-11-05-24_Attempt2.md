# üìó Dynamic Programming and Greedy Algorithms

---

## üé§ Vocabulary
- **Dynamic Programming (DP):** A method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It involves storing the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.
- **Greedy Algorithm:** An algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most immediate benefit.
- **Divide and Conquer:** An algorithmic technique that solves a problem by recursively breaking it down into smaller subproblems, solving the subproblems, and combining their solutions.
- **Optimal Substructure:** A principle where an optimal solution to a problem contains optimal solutions to its subproblems.

---

## ‚ùó Context and Significance
- This lecture focused on the integration of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms, two fundamental approaches in algorithm design. These techniques are crucial for efficiently solving optimization problems in computer science.
- Understanding these concepts is vital for designing algorithms that minimize computational costs and improve performance, especially in fields like operations research, artificial intelligence, and bioinformatics.

## ‚úíÔ∏è Scratch Notes
### Key Definitions and Notes
- **Dynamic Programming:** 
  - Memoization vs. Tabulation: Top-down (with memoization) vs. bottom-up (with tabulation).
  - Example: Fibonacci sequence calculation using dynamic programming avoids redundant calculations by storing intermediate results.

- **Greedy Algorithms:** 
  - Make the locally optimal choice at each step, aiming for a global optimum.
  - Example: Activity selection problem, where the goal is to select the maximum number of non-overlapping activities.

### Key Processes or Frameworks
- **Greedy Proof Steps:**
  1. Name the optimal solution.
  2. Identify the greedy strategy.
  3. Determine the greedy choice.
  4. Prove that the greedy solution is optimal.

- **Rod Cutting Problem:**
  - Recursive Definition: `OPT(n) = max(p[x] + OPT(n-x))` for all `x` in `[1, n]`.
  - **Pseudocode:**
    ```plaintext
    function OPT(n):
        if n == 0: return 0
        max_value = -‚àû
        for x in range(1, n+1):
            max_value = max(max_value, p[x] + OPT(n-x))
        return max_value
    ```

## ‚úíÔ∏è Scratch Notes
### Key Definitions and Notes
- **Rod Length (n):** The total length of the rod available for cutting.
- **Price (P):** The list of prices corresponding to selling rods of different lengths.
- **Revenue (R):** The maximum revenue obtainable for each sub-length of the rod.

### Key Processes or Frameworks
- **Algorithm:**
  1. Initialize `R[0] = 0` because a rod of length zero has no revenue.
  2. For each length `i` from 1 to `n`:
     - Calculate the maximum revenue `R[i]` by considering all possible first cuts `j` from 1 to `i`.
     - Use the formula: `R[i] = max(P[j] + R[i - j])` for all `j`.
  3. Store and update the maximum revenue for each length.
- Example:
  - For rod length 4, compare:
    - Cut lengths: 1, 2, 3, 4
    - Calculate: `P[1] + R[3]`, `P[2] + R[2]`, `P[3] + R[1]`, `P[4] + R[0]`
  - Choose the cut with maximum revenue.
