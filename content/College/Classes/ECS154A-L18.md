## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
### Performance
Can be defined by throughput, other times by response times
- Throughput: The amount of scalibility / things that can be finished on mass
	- ATMs: Customers don't really care how much their individual time takes, but want to get as many customers processed as possible.
- Response Times: The speed you can finish something. 
	- Weather forecast: A real time system where you need to get a forecast to a customer in time. Not interested in yesterday's forecast.

Measure Performance?
- Elapsed time
- CPU time
Ideally, we want to get a machine that's fastest on the programs we do all the time. This is hard to measure, so we measure performance on representative programs.
*Run representative Programs*
- Benchmarks: Representative of what you do with a computer

4 Types:
1) Synthetic (Dhrystrone, Whetstone, etc.)
2) Toy (Towers of Hanoi, Quicksort, etc.)
	1) Lots of recursion
3) Kernel (Livermore Loops, Lispack Loops, etc.)
4) "Real" (SPEC suite, Perfect Club, etc.)

**Kernel** - The part of the OS that has to remain in memory at all time. The core/essence of the OS.



#### Reporting Performance
MIPS
MFlop
- Mega Flop
Elapsed Time (weights)

#### Improving Performance
1) Faster clock
2) Fewer clocks/inst
3) Use fewer insts

$CPU_{time} = \frac{cycles}{prog}\cdot \frac{time}{cycle}$
$CPU_{time} = \frac{cycles}{insts}\cdot \frac{insts}{prog} \cdot \frac{time}{cycle}$
1) $\frac{cycles}{insts}$ - compiler
2) $\frac{insts}{prog}$ - organization
3) $\frac{time}{cycle}$ - technology
