## ❗ Unit and Larger Context
### Summary
Graph search uses more memory than tree-like search but avoids repeated states

Search Algorithm Evaluation  
- Completeness  
- Cost Optimality  
- Time Complexity  
- Space complexity  

Four Uninformed search algorithms  
- Breadth First Search  
- Uniform-Cost Search  
- Depth First Search  
- Iterative Deepening Depth First Search



## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes


#### More notations for our analysis:
*b (branching factor)* - Maximum number of successors of a search node
*d (depth)* - Number of actions in optimal solution
*m (maximum depth)* - Maximum actions on any path

BFS 
- Is complete, will correctly determine solution or no solution
- Will find the shortest solution first
- Total number of nodes generated is: $1+b+b^2+\dots +b^d = O(b^d)$ -> Time complexity and Space complexity
> Memory requirements quickly become a problem:
> Consider 𝑏=10, 𝑑=10, memory = 1000 bytes/node, speed = 1M nodes/sec
	- Search time (1010): 3 hours
	- Search space (1010): 10 Terabyte


### Uninformed search vs Informed search
#### Uninformed Search (blind search)
Strategies have no information about states beyond those provided in the problem definition
All they can do is generate successors and distinguish a goal state from a non-goal state
All search strategies are distinguished by the order in which nodes are expanded

**Example Algos:**
##### BFS - FIFO
- Explain more about it above
- Time and Space complexity: $O(b^d)$
##### DFS - LIFO
- Time: $O(b^m)$
	- Terrible if m >> d
	- Potentially more efficient than BFS if solutions are dense
- Space: $O(bm)$
	- Only store nodes in the current path ($O(m)$) and all frontier nodes ($O(bm)$)
	- Linear space complexity!
##### Uniform Cost Search (Also known as Best First Search)
- Instead of expanding the shallowest node like BFS, uniform cost search expands the node $n$ with the lowest path cost $f(n)$
- Implementation similar to BFS, but applies the path cost $f$
	- Orders frontiers by $f$, explores the lowest path cost
	- Effectively, Best First Search
	- Will find the path with the lowest cost
- Cannot be characterized in Time/Space complexity with *b, d, m*
*BFS is optimal if all step costs (actions) are equal, but UCS is optimal for any cost function*
##### Iterative Deepening:
- Seeks to address issues with DFS:
	- Fails in infinite-depth search spaces
	- Can be very inefficient if m >> d (m=maximum depth, d=depth of solution)
- Idea #1 (Depth Limited Search): Set a limit *I* on search depth
	- Prevents infinite growth of early paths that do not contain goal node
	- Succeeds if d <= *I*; Fails otherwise
- Idea #2 (Iterative Deepening Search, or Iterative Deepening DFS)
	- Set an initial limit *I*
	- At each next depth with no goal, increase *I*
May seem wasteful to regenerate initial states multiple times, but it is not significant. Most nodes are the bottom level of the search tree (growing by a factor of m, or I in this case). When search space is large, this reduces cost

*Completeness* - Complete
*Cost Optimality* - Optimal if step costs are equal, like BFS
*Time Complexity* - O(b^d)
*Space Complexity* - $O(bd)$
#### Informed Search or Heuristic Search
Strategies that know whether one non-goal state is "more promising" than another
