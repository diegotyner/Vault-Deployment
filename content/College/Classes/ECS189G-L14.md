## ❗ Unit and Larger Context
### Continuing with GAN


### A quick summary of GAN
##### Discriminative models vs generative models
- Examples of discriminative models
- Can we just use auto-encoders as the generative model?
- Why we need to study generative models?
##### Generative Adversarial Model
- The game between generator and discriminator
- How to train the model iteratively
##### What can GAN do?
- Some examples
- More to be explored by you!
- Source code tutorials: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dcgan_faces_tutorial.html


## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
**REVIEW GAN LOSS FUNCTION, FINAL QUESTION ON IT**
### Begin class by reviewing how to define and fix D and G loss functions in GAN
Iterate by fixing G, then optimizing D
then fixing D, then optimizing G
- Do this iteratively to efficiently optimize them both to convergence

Stages:
1) Poorly fit G and D
2) G will approach the underlying data distribution
3) D will adjust making some strategy to differentiate the two, even if its mostly probabilistics
4) G will fit, be indistinguishable from the data
5) D will start guessing randomly, will be unable to tell the data apart

##### GAN Uses
Turn input into generated images, not just feeding noise:
- Sketch bag to real bag
- Sketch face to real face
- Face to emoji
- Input face, aging
- Text to image

### Computer Vision
- The science and technology that make machines "see"
- Image data can be diverse
	- B/W, gray scale, RBG
	- Videos (sequences of images)
		- Normally at least 24 FPS
	- Depth images, like Lidar with point cloud
	- High-dimension medical scanning images
		- A high dimensional image tensor (multi-bytes per pixel)

#### Vision for humans
Very powerful vision system inherited from our ancestors
- Evolving for millions of years
Our brain is "initialized" to recognize items at our birth
We can perceive items in the 3D space effectively

#### Back to CV
Is computer vision that hard?
- Yes...
- Very hard for current computers

Need to make machine vision system from scratch
- Choose how to see, camera vs. lidar
- How to identify humans vs cars
- How to learn, DL or other methods

But have advantages too: human vision weak to optical illusions (visual processing relative, contextual)

#### CV Problems
- Image classification
- Object
	- Localization
	- Detection
	- Segmentation
- Image
	- Style transfer
	- Reconstruction
	- Super-resolution
	- Synthesis
- others...
