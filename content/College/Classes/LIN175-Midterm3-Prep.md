### Study Guide: Neurobiology of Language Midterm  
#### Neurological Basis of Language Disorders  
- Differences between aphasia and motor speech impairments (e.g., Broca’s vs. Wernicke’s vs. Conduction aphasia)  
	- Language disorders can arise from many different problems:
		- Broca's: Speech production. Broken / difficulty producing words. Non fluent aphasia.
		- Wernicke's: Speech comprehension. Fluent aphasia. Nonsense
		- Conduction Aphasia: Language comprehension mostly intact, but production is distorted by phonemic paraphasias and repetition is severely compromised.
			- 2 theories (W.L. model and 2 pathways)
				- Disconnection syndrome
				- Impaired transfer of acoustic image of words to motor programs via arcuate fasciculus
				  
				- Left supramarginal gyrus
				- Interiorly adjacent tissue deep inside the sylvian fissure
					- Damage to sensorimotor interface, area Spt
				- *This is different than the claim in the W.L. model, that claims it arises from damage to the arcuate fasciculus*
- Selective vocal cord impairment and its effects on speech production  
- Speech errors: phonemic vs. semantic paraphasias, neologisms, and tip-of-the-tongue states  
	- Phonemic: Substitute phoneme for another (cat -> bat)
	- Semantic: Substitute word for semantically related word (cat -> tiger)
	- Neologistic: Insert strings of speech sounds for a word target (toothbrush -> sez sez sez sez, hospital -> nezaful)
#### Neural Models of Language Processing  
- Wernicke-Lichtheim-Geschwind model  
![[Wernicke-Lictheim-Geschwind-Model.png|400]]
	- M: Broca's
	- B: Concepts (distributed)
	- A:  Wernicke's
	- Disproved because of double dissociation between language comprehension and speech perception
		- Deficit in comprehension: posterior STS (superior temporal sulcus) lesions
		- Deficit in perception: inferior frontal lesion (and parietal)

- Dual-Stream Model (Dorsal vs. Ventral pathways)  
![[Dual-Stream-Model-of-Speech-Processing.png|400]]
	- Split into what and where pathways. Similar dorsal/ventral pathways exist in [[Vision|vision]]
		- Dorsal (upper): *Where*
			- Sensorimotor articulation
			- Doing things with language
		- Ventral (lower): *What*
			- Lexical/conceptual processing
Key to note: The initial auditory processing steps (spectro temporal analysis and phonological network) are processed bilaterally. 
	- *Spectro Temporal Analysis:* Dorsal STG (superior temporal gyrus). 
		- Spectrogram analysis of speech? Key part of converting frequencies to phonemes
	- *Phonological Network:* Mid-post STS (superior temporal sulcus)
	- *Conceptual Network:* WIDELY distributed across cortex. 
	- *Ventral Stream:*  "Where". Map sound structure to semantic representations. Forms integrated meanings of complex utterances.
		- *Combinatorial Network:* aMTG/pMTG (anterior middle temporal gyrus), pITG/aITS (anterior inferior temporal gyrus)
			- Higher order region thought to implement a combinatorial network that plays an important role in constructing the integrated meanings of phrases and sentences, drawing upon both semantic and grammatical information.
			- Left hemisphere dominant
			- Not well elaborated on (in the literature)
		- *Lexical Interface:* pMTG, pITS 
			- A relay station to getting from the phonological structures of words to their semantic structures
			- Weak left hemisphere dominance
	- *Dorsal Stream:* "How". From sound to action. Mapping perceptual representations of vocal sounds onto motor representations
		- *Sensorimotor Interface:* Parietal-Temporal Spt? Spt == (Sylvian parietal temporal, located at the parietal temporal boundary, and a subportion of area tpt)
			- Appears to operate as a device for coordinating or translating between the sound based phonological network in the lateral temporal lobe and the motor based articulatory network in the posterior frontal lobe
		- *Articulatory Network:* pIFG (posterior inferior frontal gyrus), PM (premotor cortex), Anterior Insula
			- Speech production / auditory verbal short term memory (STM) / Speech perception

- The role of Broca’s area, Wernicke’s area, and Middle Temporal Gyrus in language processing  
	- Broca's: 
	- Wernicke's: 
	- Middle Temporal Gyrus: 
- The function of the lexical interface and the sensorimotor interface in language   comprehension  
	- Lexical Interface: Sound -> Word representation/Semantic Structures. Bilateral.
		- "What does this sound mean?"
	- Sensorimotor Interface: Sound -> Motor coordination of speech.
		- "How will i move my body to achieve this action?"
- fMRI and PET findings on speech perception and comprehension  
	- Helps us to discover which regions correspond to what stimulus
		- Think of a control study for real intelligible vs unintelligible multi word utterances. Will isolate activation to higher level regions (corresponded to meaning)
			- This study found activation in left lateral ATL (anterior temporal lobe)
			- ATL may serve as a semantic hub binding diverse lexical concepts?
#### Aphasia and Language Processing  
- Characteristics of Broca’s aphasia vs. Wernicke’s aphasia  
	- Broca’s aphasia 
	- Wernicke’s aphasia  
- Closed-class lexical deficits and their effects on sentence comprehension  
	- Open-class words - nouns, lexical verbs, adjectives, and adverbs
	- Closed-class words - pronouns, determiners, conjunctions, and prepositions
		- Do not readily accept new members, have a finite set
- Tests for phonemic discrimination  
- Double dissociation between word comprehension and syllable awareness  
#### Sign Language and the Brain  
- How signed languages lead to similar aphasia patterns as spoken languages  
	- Similarities: Left centralized.  A case study of right hemispheric damage was able to keep language abilities despite having unilateral neglect. 
	- Differences
- Differences in left vs. right hemisphere involvement in signed vs. spoken language  
	- Highly similar areas in left and right hemisphere (BSL and English)
	- Spoken:
		- Left: Language
			- Speech
			- Reading
		- Right: Spatial information
			- Face recognition
			- Maps/Route
	  - Signing:
		  - Left: Language
		  - Right: Spatial information
- The role of spatial syntax in right hemisphere processing  
#### Language Acquisition and Bilingualism  
- Critical period hypothesis for second language learning  
- Bilingual brain organization: coordinate, compound, and subordinate bilingualism  
	- *Compound Bilingual:* L1 and L2 are learned concurrently at home.
		- Often mother and father may speak different languages, or family. Language acquired in the same environment
	- *Coordinate Bilingual:* L2 is learned after L1 (after around school age.)
		- Languages learned in different contexts, home vs school.
	- *Subordinated Bilingualism:* L1 is dominant and translates in into L2. 
		- Weaker language is interpreted through the first
		- You think in L1, and consciously interpret into L2
- How brain damage affects bilingual aphasia recovery
	- *Pitres Law:* The most familiar language is the one that tends to be recovered
	- *Minkowski's Law:* The language with the strongest emotional association is less impaired, and recovers first
	- Recovery Trajectories, will use languages A and B as shorthand:
		- Parallel ($\uparrow A=\uparrow B$)
		- Selective ($\uparrow A \neq B$) - B no improvement
		- Differential ($\uparrow \uparrow A=\uparrow B$). A recovers faster
		- Substantial ($\uparrow A \neq B \to \uparrow A=\uparrow \uparrow B$) - Initial stagnation, but explosive growth later
		- Antagonistic ($\uparrow A \neq B \to \downarrow A=\uparrow B$) - One recovers while the other doesn't, or even worsens
	- Mixed recovery - Inappropriate and unrestricted blending of languages. Suggested to be cognitive control, role of inhibition in Wernicke's aphasia. Inhibition to select (suppress) a language. Broken "language switch"
- Factors affecting bilingual brain activation  
#### Neuroprosthetics and Language Recovery  
- Neuroprosthetic research (NEJM article): brain-computer interfaces for speech restoration in ALS  
- How the neuroprosthetic works: decoding neural signals for speech production  
- Components of the neuroprosthetic (implantation sites, neural decoding)  
#### Theoretical and Research Considerations  
- The role of exploratory research in neurolinguistics (e.g., discovery of N400 & P600 ERPs)  
	- N400
	- P600
	- Exploratory research: Creating theories has been difficult, so a lot of research devoted to exploration
- Importance of falsifiability in scientific theories  
	- Need to be specific enough to both make predictions and be tested/proven incorrect. 
		- Being difficult to disprove is bad
- Use of models in neurolinguistic research
	- Guide research, make predictions, allow interesting questions
