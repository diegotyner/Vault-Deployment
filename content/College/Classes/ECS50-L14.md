Small summary




## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
### Syntax For Inline
- Read inputs section first
- Inline will save registers you "tell them about" and restore them after execution
	- Could mess things up if you don't tell it about it and use it anyway
- Does not follow GCC calling conventions
- `+a (a)`  
	- Applied in output section
	- Before runs a will go to EAX (a -> EAX)
	- EAX will be copied to a (EAX -> a)
- can use "`r`" to refer to *any* register
	- "+r" (a), "=r" (temp)
		- // a -> random register, random register -> a on output
		- // random register -> temp
- `m` - Memory
- `g` - General?
- "Compiler assumes that you will not write to outputs before you are done using all of your inputs"
- `[b] "m" (b)` - m makes `b` be stored in memory
```
__asm__(
assembly code :
outputs :
inputs : 
clobbered 
);
// outputs,inputs, and clobbered are all optional
```
```
int abcAdd(int a, int b) {
	int result;
	__asm__(
	"movl %%ebx, %%eax;"
	"addl %%ecx, %%eax;"
	"movl $12, %%edx;" :
	"=a (result)" : // = sign means that result will be overwritten
	// After code runs, copy EAX into result
	// =S (result) would mean copy ESI into result
	"b" (b), "c" (a) : // b -> EBX and c -> ECX
	"cc", "%edi" // This tells it things to modify
	// modify "cc" flags
	// modify "edi"
	)
}
```
