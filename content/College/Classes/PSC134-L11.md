## 🧪-> Example
 1. Why would brain damage lead to neglect/difficulties on invalid trials?
    It causes a deficit in managing attention, which is most evident when attention is required to be distributed from one side side of space to another. This could be because the damaged area of the brain is responsible for 'bolstering' the signal to give it attention, but is unable to bolster it to relevance when has competition from the other intact hemisphere  .
2. Based on your answer to #1, what do you predict would happen on invalid trials with damage to both left and right parietal cortex?
   Since both hemispheres are damaged, neither side of space will be overwhelmed by the bolstered signal from the other side. When it comes to perception of space, they might be able to regain functionality of their attention.
