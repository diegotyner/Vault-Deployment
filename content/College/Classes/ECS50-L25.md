## 🎤 Vocab



## ❗ Unit and Larger Context
### Final Review Topics
- It's all bits
- Bitwise operators
- How many bits needed to represent
	- With B bits
- Unsigned, Sign magnitude, 2s complement
- Floatign point
- Hex
- Covnerting Between bases
- Structus
- Arrays, multidimensional
- Debugging
- Assembly / Intel cheat sheet
	- Advanced indexing (accessing memory)
		- leal
- GCC calling conventions
- Components of computer
	- Components of computer
- Why programs aren't portable
- Inline assembly
- Stack and Stack frames
- Prologue and epilogue
- I/O
	- Polling vs interrupt driven I/O
	- Memory mapped vs I/O mapped
	- Interrupts
	- OS
		- What does it do
		- Applications loaded
		- Bootloader an how it loads the OS
		- Time sharing
- System calls
- Parallelism pipelining 
	- Programmer: Message passing or shared memory
- Instructions are represented with bits
	- Internals of representation




## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
[Linux System Call Tables](https://faculty.nps.edu/cseagle/assembly/sys_call.html)
`int $0x80` system calls
- 

Virtual Memory
- Notice how no matter how many times you run a program, you always have the same pointer values, the same 'addresses'
- On creating an application, given virtual memory
- Allocated in 'blocks'
	- Won't go past block with a +1 error, only seg faults (going past allocated block) when you go *significantly* past your block


#### Printing From Assembly
```
fun(int a, int b, int c) {
	int x, y, z;

	p ((int *)$ebp)[2]@3  # print args
	p ((int *)$ebp)[-3]@3 # print locals
}
```


### Midterm 2 Review
> 1. CPU instructions
```
100,000 * 4 / 50,000
```

> 4.  Conflicting compiler instructions
```
jb/jae or jl/jge
Don't know how to compare signed and unsigned
```

> 5. Just push, pop, and call manually
```
praerielearn
```

> 6. 1 GDB command to print out the value before it returns
```
p $eax
```

> 7. Allocating space for program
```
same as praerielearn, instruction / data or text
```

> 8. Which parts are part of the stack
```
everything greater or equal than ESP pointing to
```

> 9. Save registers? Minimal set for callee
```
Caller:
- Save only ACD

Callee:
- Save everything but ACD

ESP is weird, left off the exam
- Consider it Callee saved
```

> 10. Write down the component name
```
Instruction - IR
Address of instruct - PC
Communicate - BUS
MAR
MDR
Arithmatetic - ALU
Stores running data - Memory
Points to top of stack - ESP
```

> 11. Whats in MAR and MDR?
```
movl %eax, %ebx: 
- MAR: No Value
- MDR: No Value

push %edx: 
- MAR: 996 (subtract 4 from 1000)
- MDR: 50(value pushed)

movl 400(%eax, %edx, 4), %ecx:
- MAR: 1600 (value computed)
- MDR: -786 (value at 1600)

ret
- MAR: 1000 (the memory popped from)
- MDR: 255 (the value popped)

movw $77, ($ebp)
- MAR: 200
- MDR: 77

pop %ecx
- 1000
- 255

movb (%esi, %ebx), %dh
- 3100 
- Unknown (past addresses shown)

```


### Inline Assembly
`bextr` - Bit extraction?

```cpp
bextr.cpp

unsigned int get_bits(int from, int start, int end) {
	int num_bits = end - start + 1;
	unsigned result;
	__asm__(
		//code
		"movb %%al, %%ch"
		"movb %%bl, %%cl"
		"bextr %%ecx, %[from], %[result]"
		:
		//outputs
		[result] "=r" (result)
		:
		//inputs
		[from] "r" (from), [start]"b"(start), [amount] "a" (num_bits)
		:
		//clobbering
		"cc", "%ecx"
	);
}

int main() {
	unsigned int val = 0b011 1011 1101 1101;
	unsigned int bits = get_bits(val, 4, 9);
	printf("%x\n", bits); // prints 1D
	return 0;
}
```
