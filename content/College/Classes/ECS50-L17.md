## ❗ Unit and Larger Context
Small summary



## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
### Leal
Provides an address, does not dereference memory. Copies the address.
`Leal d(o,i,s), register`
LEA = Load Effective Address

### Function Calling
The *caller* will push args to the stack in reverse order (so the first arg is on top, f(a,b,c) => push c, b, a)
- It also pushes a return label/address to continue execution from

The *callee* then deals with the EBP, ESP, and maintaining registers
#### Prologue
> Establish the stack frame for the current function
> EBP holds the pointer to the start of the stack frame
> Stack frame is everything between EBP and ESP
> The stack frame gives you a fixed location for accessing locals and arguments
> ESP keeps changing throughout the runtime of your function so it makes really hard to keep accessing locals and args through it because it keeps changing
```
push %ebp
movl %esp, %ebp
subl $num_locals * ws, %esp
Push those registers
```

#### EBP Offsets for args:
**Positive** offsets are function arguments
**Negative** offsets are local variables

##### After the prologue of fun1(a,b,c)
![[Function-Call-Stack-1.png|500]]
> Can move up to a future by following the ebp pointers of call stack
```
movl %ebp, %eax // ebp into eax
movl (%eax), %eax // following the ebp pointer (fun3->fun2)
movl (%eax), %eax // following the ebp pointer (fun2->fun1)
movl 2*ws(%eax), %eax // accessing the 1st fun1 arg, a
```

#### Epilogue
*Undoes the prologue*
> Restore saved registers
> Remove the locals
> Restore the old stack frame
```
Pop the saved registers off the stack or move them off the stack
movl %ebp, %esp
pop %ebp
```
##### After the epilogue of fun3(f,g)

### Calling Malloc
A function, like any other. Feed it args through stack
- Can multiply by 4 (ws) fast with `shll $2, %eax (shift left 2 bits)`
```
push %eax
call malloc        # return value is in eax
movl %eax, C(%ebp) # moving it to our local C variable
addl $1*ws, %esp   # remove our arg from the stack 
```
