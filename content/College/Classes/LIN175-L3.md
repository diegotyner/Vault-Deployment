## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
#### Vasculature
**Arteries** - Large vessels that carry oxygenated blood from the heart to the rest of the body, including the brain
**Arterioles** - Small arteries
**Capillaries** - Very small, thin walled vessels where oxygen is extracted
**Veins** - bring deoxygenated blood back to the heart

#### Blood Flow
- Neurons consume about 20% of the oxygenated blood flowing from the heart
- This blood reaches "the fine-grained capillary bed in the brain"
	- Capillaries are very thin, diameter of about 10 micrometers

#### More Anatomy:
**Brain Stem** - A set of three vertically aligned structures—the *medulla*, *pons*, and *midbrain*—that lie at the base of the brain and are essential for the regulation of bodily homeostasis.

**Thalamus**:
- On top of the brain stem
- Bilaterally symmetrical
- Relay station of the brain
- Contains:
	- *Medial geniculate nucleus (MGN)* - Audition
	- *Lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN)* - Vision
- All known connections between thalamus and cerebral cortex are reciprocal, two way radiations (thalamocortical and corticothalamic)

**Hippocampus**
- One in each hemispere, deep in the temporal lobe
- Essential for encoding of long term declarative memories

**Amygdala**
- Patient SM's amygdala did not develop, and she was not able to recognize fear in herself or others

#### Gross Neuroanatomy
![[Brain-Labeled-Sulcus-Gyrus.png]]
- **1** - Lateral Sulcus. Very important for navigating brain
- **7** - Central Sulcus. Divides frontal and parietal lobes
![[Major-Cortical-Landmarks.png]]
- General pattern of dividing: 
	1) Superior
	2) Middle
	3) Inferior
