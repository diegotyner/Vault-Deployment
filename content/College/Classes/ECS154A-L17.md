- Minimal example of CPU, capable of executing instructions
- X and Z are buffers, to hold the data and prevent signals from mixing (bus can't hold A and B at same time, need temp storage in X) (same with Z)

- FDE Cycle:
	1) Fetch - Gets the instruction
	2) Decode - Decodes the fetched information, translates it
	3) Execute - Does what the instruction told it to
- Going through this cycle is effectively a big Moore model, going through the states of each step.


### Example Steps for Instructions

| Cycle | Instructions           |                          |                      |                     |
| ----- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------- |
| 0     | PC -> Bus ($PC_{out}$) | Bus -> MAR ($MAR_{in}$ ) | Send the READ signal | BUS -> X ($X_{in}$) |
| 1     | INC B ($Z_{in}$)       |                          |                      |                     |
| 2     | Z -> Bus               | Bus -> PC                |                      |                     |
| 3     | MDR -> Bus             | Bus -> IR                |                      |                     |
| 4     | ACC -> Bus             | Bus -> X                 |                      |                     |
| 5     | R -> Bus               | ADD                      | $Z_{in}$             |                     |
| 6     | Z -> Bus               | Bus -> ACC               |                      |                     |
- Instructions for ADD R
	- ADD R: ACC = ACC + R

| Cycle | Instructions         |                          |                      |
| ----- | -------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------- |
| n     | R -> Bus ($R_{out}$) | Bus -> MAR ($MAR_{in}$ ) | Send the READ signal |
| n+1   | ACC -> Bus           | Bus -> X                 |                      |
| n+2   | MDR -> Bus           | ADD                      | $Z_{in}$             |
| n+3   | Z -> Bus             | B -> ACC                 |                      |
| n+4   |                      |                          |                      |
| n+5   |                      |                          |                      |
- Instructions for ADD mem(R)
	- ACC (R): CC = ACC + mem(R)

##### Comparison:
ADD R takes 3 execute cycles
ADD (R) takes 4 execute cycles

We can see that the limiting factor here is sharing the bus. Multiple buses could mean faster execution!

- Visualized as a Moore Model


#### Continuation
> [!tip] You can speed it up by adding another bus! Or another! Or another!

![[Simple-Microarchitecture-2-Bus.png]]

![[Simple-Microarchitecture-3-Bus.png]]

With 3 buses, you can do the entire instruction of add in ONE cycle!


**CISC** - Complex Instruction Set Computer
**RISC** - Reduced Instruction Set Computer

Which is faster?
- Define faster! 
- CISC has more instructions than RISC, but RISC manages them better.
