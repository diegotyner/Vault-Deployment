## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
**Convergent evolution**: creates analogous structures that have similar form or function but were not present in the last common ancestor of those groups.

40% of birds are songbirds
- Many birds sing to attract mates, but songbird songs are special because they are depend on auditory and vocal experience
- Songbirds learn their communication, making them similar to humans. (songs not innate)

#### Why study Birdsong?
- easily observed and measured behavior
- clearly dependent (like many complex behaviors) on internal state and motivation
- there's nice specialized circuitry to produce and represent song
	- neural control of motor behaviors
- good model system for vocal and motor learning, too.
	- Mammals: humans, cetaceans, some bats
	- Birds: songbirds, parrots, some hummingbirds
Songbird brains are different from non-songbirds (more complex, diff areas)

#### Songbirds Learning
- They have a sensitive period where they can absorb song, and it is then crystallized in adulthood (in zebra finch, 25-80 days)
- Subsong → first vocalizations (~30-40 days after hatching) (babbling)
- Plastic Song → a song that resembles the tutor song (more than the subsong) but can still be altered (starts at ~50-70 days old).
- Crystallized Song → Finalization of learning. It resembles the tutor song (~90-100 days old)
#### Control Pathways
![[Songbird-Control-Pathways.png]]
- Direct motor pathway (red)
	- Production of song
- Anterior forebrain pathway (blue)
	- Sensory motor learning of song
- HVC may be considered part of both pathways


#### Sexual Dimorphism
- Birdsong production is sexually dimorphic in zebra finch and many other songbirds
- Dimorphism also exists in neuroanatomy
![[Zebra-Finch-Neuroanatomical-Sexual-Dimorphism.png]]


Two types of hormonal effects:
1) Organizational effects - build the system early in development
2) Activation effects - trigger immediate behavior later in life

Testing the hypothesis that dimorphism in HVC and RA are caused by elevated androgen (male estrogen) in development
- DHT and estradiol (E2) are androgens in birds

E2 and DHT in just-hatches birds will cause singing in females (normally no singing)
- This is an organizational effect, causing behavior later in life



### Song Development: Zebra Finch
They only sing one song, and it is extremely stereotyped
- Gaps and syllable length are the same
- Same spectral structure to each syllable
- Same temporal sequence

- Elements/Note: a unit of uninterrupted song that has a coherent time / frequency structure that distinguishes it from neighboring elements/notes.
- Notes combined to form syllables (a,b,c..), separated by breaths

- Syllables: basic element of a conspecific song. They develop and crystallize (a, b, c, d, … ).
- Motifs: introductory notes (i) followed by a sequence of syllables. They develop and crystallize.
- Bouts: sequence of motifs not necessarily stereotyped even in adult.

#### Innate or Learned?
- Lacking the auditory exposure to any adult tutor during the critical phase of sensory learning, led to abnormal and quite simple songs.
- As they develop, they will imitate the song of an adult male tutor

Some birds are more complex and have seasonal songs, zebra finches are a very simple case.

#### Songs
- Undirected song - not accompanied by the dance, produced when the male is with other males, alone, or outside a nest occupied by its mate
- Directed song - accompanied by a courtship dance and is addressed almost exclusively to females 

- Variability in syllable structure is greater in the undirected condition. (like they are rehearsing)
- Also, less number of introductory notes

Task was created were time a female spent in a box was measured, comparing:
1) Unfamiliar directed motif
2) Mate's directed motif
3) Mate's undirected motif
Females showed a strong preference:
- Mate's directed >> Unfamiliar direct
- Mate's directed >> Mate's undirected
