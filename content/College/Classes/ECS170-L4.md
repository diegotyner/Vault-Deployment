## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes

### Problems with tree search:
Paths with repeated states are non optimal (finding node A again in the tree)
Two typical solutions:
- Ignore if likelihood of repetition is very low. Do a tree-like search
- Do a graph search, keep a list of reached/visited states. Dependent on all states fitting easily in memory.

### Graph Search: 
#### Separation property of graph search
*Graph Search*: no state occurs on more than one path
During the search, states are in one of three disjoint subsets:
1) Expanded node (visited and explored)
2) Nodes in the frontier (reached but not expanded)
	- Functionally, has to do with being in the queue to be explored
3) Nodes that have not been reached 

> Graph search algorithm is the same as tree search, with the addition of the explored set

### Evaluating search algorithms
1) *Completeness* - If there is a solution, is the algo guaranteed to find it?
	- Sometimes this can be do to time complexity, a DFS algorithm might get stuck in an infinite loop if poorly implemented
2) *Cost Optimality* - Will the algorithm find the optimal/lowest cost solution?
3) *Time Complexity* - How much time to find a solution
4) *Space Complexity* - How much space is needed to find a solution?

#### More notations for our analysis:
*b (branching factor)* - Maximum number of successors of a search node
*d (depth)* - Number of actions in optimal solution
*m (maximum depth)* - Maximum actions on any path
