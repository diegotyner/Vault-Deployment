Small summary




## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
![[Wernicke-Lictheim-Geschwind-Model.png|300]]
- A deficit: Wernicke's
- M deficit: Halting speech, broca's
- B deficit: 
- M -> A deficit: Conduction aphasia, can't hear something then repeat it
- Auditory deficit: Something in the cochlea
- Motor deficit: Intact language etc, unable to actually execute the motor commands
	- Orabuchal apraxia: Test for by asking to do simple motor commands, like make a kissy face, lick an ice cream cone, sip a straw

*Broca's Area* - Speech Production
*Wernicke's* - Speech Comprehension
*Conduction Aphasia* 
- Disconnection syndrome
- Impaired transfer of acoustic image of words to motor programs via *arcuate fasciculus*

Limitations of Wernicke Model:
- Dissociations between speech perception and speech comprehension
- Bilateral activity in functional imaging studies
	- Right hemisphere might have a role in understanding intonation (really? vs. *really?*)

#### Speech Tasks
Each of the below are slightly different from each other, and draw on different substrates.

Speech Comprehension Tasks
- Show me the tree (out of 4 pictures)

Word comprehension
- What does a pediatrician do ?

Follow the instructions:
- Touch your nose and then point to the ceiling.

Speech (Sound) Perception Tasks  
- “Phoneme discrimination”:  
	- TAZ DAZ MONT MANT PAS PAZ

How many syllables ?  
- caterpillar, thorough, estuary etc.

Syllable detection (in pseudowords) press a button when you hear “det”  
- manideten betenship plomesdet etc.

#### Uses
Surprisingly, there's a double dissociation between *language comprehension tasks* and *speech perception*
- This contradicts the flow that we would expect from Wernicke's model
