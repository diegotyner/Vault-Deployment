## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
### Informed Search
Compares to uninformed search
Improves by using *heuristics*, improves upon Uniform-Cost Search (UCS)
- UCS uses priority queue ordered by an evaluation funct $f(n)$
- $f(n)$ is path cost function on path from start node to current node

However, we're interested in path from start to goal, not start to current node
- Replace 𝑓(𝑛) with a new function 𝑓(𝑛) = 𝑔(𝑛) + ℎ(𝑛)  
- 𝑔(𝑛): path cost so far to the current node n  
- ℎ(𝑛): estimated cost from the current node 𝑛 to goal  
	- computation of ℎ(𝑛) uses heuristic knowledge to get  
a good estimate  
- 𝑓(𝑛): estimated total cost of path through 𝑛 to goal

*Relaxed Problems and Heuristics*  
A problem with fewer restrictions on the actions than the original is called a relaxed problem  
> The solution to a relaxed problem is a heuristic for the original problem

### Criteria for Good Heuristic Functions
*Admissibility* - An admissible heuristic never overestimates the distance to the goal
*Consistency* - A heuristic is consistent if, for every node $n$ and its successor $n'$, cost function $c$, action $a$, and goal state $G$, we have $h(n) \geq c(n,a,n')+h(n')$, similar as the *triangle inequality* in geometry

*Dominance as a metric* 
Intuition: Pick an optimistic heuristic that is as accurate as possible
If $h_2(n) >= h_1(n)$ for all $n$ (both admissible)
- Then $h_2$ dominates $h_1$, or $h_2$ is more accurate than $h_1$
- $h_2$ is therefore better for search than h1
