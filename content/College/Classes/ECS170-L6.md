## 🎤 Vocab



## ❗ Unit and Larger Context
### Heuristic (Informed) Search (AIMA 3.5, 3.6)  
- Heuristic Search (AIMA 3.5, 3.6)  
	- What is a heuristic?  
	- How to define good heuristics?  
- Greedy Best First (AIMA 3.5)  
- A* (pronounced A-star) (AIMA 3.5)  


### Heuristic Search
Heuristic search relies on selection of good heuristics  
- Find heuristics through relaxed versions of the problem  
- Two criteria for good heuristics: admissibility, consistency  
- Can prune the search space by many orders of magnitude  
Greedy Best First: 𝑓(𝑛) = ℎ(𝑛)  
- Same as Best First with the evaluation function equal to the heuristic function  
- Not complete, therefore not optimal  
A* Search: 𝑓(𝑛) = 𝑔(𝑛) + ℎ(𝑛)  
- Best known of Best First methods  
- Optimal if heuristic is consistent, therefore complete  



## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
### Informed Search
Compares to uninformed search
Improves by using *heuristics*, improves upon Uniform-Cost Search (UCS)
- UCS uses priority queue ordered by an evaluation funct $f(n)$
- $f(n)$ is path cost function on path from start node to current node

However, we're interested in path from start to goal, not start to current node
- Replace 𝑓(𝑛) with a new function 𝑓(𝑛) = 𝑔(𝑛) + ℎ(𝑛)  
- 𝑔(𝑛): path cost so far to the current node n  
- ℎ(𝑛): estimated cost from the current node 𝑛 to goal  
	- computation of ℎ(𝑛) uses heuristic knowledge to get  
a good estimate  
- 𝑓(𝑛): estimated total cost of path through 𝑛 to goal

*Relaxed Problems and Heuristics*  
A problem with fewer restrictions on the actions than the original is called a relaxed problem  
> The solution to a relaxed problem is a heuristic for the original problem

### Criteria for Good Heuristic Functions
*Admissibility* - An admissible heuristic never overestimates the distance to the goal
*Consistency* - A heuristic is consistent if, for every node $n$ and its successor $n'$, cost function $c$, action $a$, and goal state $G$, we have $h(n) \geq c(n,a,n')+h(n')$, similar as the *triangle inequality* in geometry

*Dominance as a metric* 
Intuition: Pick an optimistic heuristic that is as accurate as possible
If $h_2(n) >= h_1(n)$ for all $n$ (both admissible)
- Then $h_2$ dominates $h_1$, or $h_2$ is more accurate than $h_1$
- $h_2$ is therefore better for search than h1

For the 8-tile puzzle:
- $h_{oop}(n) =$ number of out of place tiles
- $h_{md}(n) =$ total Manhattan distance (i.e. number number of moves from desired location of each tile)
$h_{md}$ dominates $h_{oop}$


### Greedy Best First Search
Given a cost function: 𝑓(𝑛) = 𝑔(𝑛) + ℎ(𝑛)  
- $g(n)$ is path cost so far to n
- $h(n)$ is heuristic estimate for n to goal

Greedy Best First ignores $g(n)$, so $f(n) = h(n)$

##### Evaluation:
*Completeness?* - No, can get stuck in loops when using tree search
*Cost Optimality?* - No, just finds node n with lowest path to goal

Complexities:
- Time - $O(b^d)$, worst case like DFS
- Space - $O(b^m)$, priority queue keeping all unexpanded nodes in memory

### A* search
Best known form of best-first search
- Avoid expanding expensive paths
- Expand most promising first
- Uses the classic 𝑓(𝑛) = 𝑔(𝑛) + ℎ(𝑛) 
- Implementation: Frontier with a PQ
##### Evaluation
*Completeness?* - Yes, if heuristic is consistent
*Cost Optimality?* - Yes, if heuristic is consistent
