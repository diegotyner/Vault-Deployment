## 🎤 Vocab



## ❗ Unit and Larger Context
Lecture was help over Zoom



## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
Local Alignment Operation:
- O($|T| \cdot |P|$)
	- Length of the *Text* times length of the *Pattern* 

Suffix Tree Data Structure
- Allows us to search within text in time proportional to length of pattern

Suffix Tree for:
- T=babababa$

| Suffix: | Text      |
| ------- | --------- |
| 1       | babababa$ |
| 2       | abababa$  |
| 3       | bababa$   |
| 4       | ababa$    |
| 5       | baba$     |
| 6       | aba$      |
| 7       | ba$       |
| 8       | a$        |
| 9       |           |

- $O(n^2)$ on paper for creation
- $O(n)$ using Divide and Conquer Approach (ECS 122b)



#### 2. De Novo Algorithm
If .... known, construct from scratch

CS Concept: Graph Algorithms
- Hamiltonian Circuit Problem
- Eulerian Circuit Problem

Graphs are Data Structure
- G: (set V, set E)
- set V = set of Nodes
- set E $\subseteq (V \times V)$ 
- Graphs can be directed or undirected
	- Undirected: $E \subseteq (a,b) \iff  E \subseteq (b,a)$
	- Directed: No such implication, and edge (a,b) means that node a is connected b, but not necessarily vice versa

Hamiltonian Circuit: Path that visits each *node* only once and returns to the start
Eulerian Circuit: Path such that each edge used exactly once and return to the start and visit each node



##### Ex:
Bruin Graphs??
a) Imagine a circular genome, that can be in any order:
- AATGGCGTGCA or AAATGGCGTGC or ....
b) Input:
- ATGGCGT
	- GGCGTGC
		- CGTGCAA
			- TGCAATG
				- CAAGGC
					- ATGGCGT
n1 -> n2
- Suffix(n1) prefix(n2) >= 5
- - De Bruin Graph, based on 3char strives


*What is the point?*
Genome assembly comes in 2 types:
1) Potential genome suffix action?
2) De Novo assembly 

*On quiz:*
Run BLAST on paper
- Can you create step 1 of BLAST? (3 letter sequences)
Given HSP has the following:
- $HSP[{ata}] = {gat, att}$
What are seeds to BLAST search?
- Seeds: Set A & {att}
