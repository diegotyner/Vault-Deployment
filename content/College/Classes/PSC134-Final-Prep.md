> What leads a neuron to fire, signaling that it has detected relevant input?
> a) Most neurons receive direct input from the world, so they fire when they see (or hear, or feel, etc.) things in the world that they are tuned to detect.
> b) Neurons receive a mix of excitatory and inhibitory inputs, and they fire if the excitatory inputs win the competition and get them over threshold to fire.
> c) Neurons receive language-like inputs, so a neuron will fire if the neurons it receives input from send relevant instructions (e.g., “It’s election day so I should vote.”).
```
b - Most neurons are direct sensory neurons, in brain helping processing. They also do not receive language inputs. Instead, they receive excitatory and inhibitory inputs.

> Which of the following is NOT true of neural networks?
> a) Bidirectional connections support pattern completion (taking partial information and filling in the rest). Think faces sim.
> b) Feedforward inhibition anticipates incoming activity levels, and feedback inhibition reacts to activity levels, together regulating overall activity. Think inhib sim.
> c) Attractor dynamics prevent networks from settling into stable states. Think necker cube sim.
> d) Categories/similarity can be captured by overlapping distributed representations. Think cats-and-dogs sim.
```
c - They help them settle into stable states, not prevent.

> Which of the following is NOT true of learning in neural networks?
> a) Learning is driven by patterns of neural firing.
> b) Effects of learning are captured in the strength of connection weights (synapses) between units.
> c) Self-organizing learning picks up on statistical patterns; error-driven learning generates responses that match correct targets.
> d) Learning cannot solve problems that are harder than simple one-to-one mappings.

> Which of the following contribute to the formation of topographically organized edge detectors in V1? (select all that apply)
> a) lateral excitatory connections among V1 neurons
> b) the commonality of edges in the world
> c) ocular dominance columns
> d) self-organizing learning that picks up on regularities in the world
> e) the optic chiasm
```
a) Lateral connections
b) Commonality of edges in the world
d) self organizing learning

> How does the V1 receptive field simulation form edge detectors?
> A) They are built in from the start, to simulate genetic programming
> B) They develop through self-organizing learning that picks up on the regularities of edges in the world
> C) They develop through error-driven learning that requires tuning in to edges to identify objects correctly
> D) They develop through reinforcement learning, with greater than expected rewards when units detect edges

> How does the object AA model solve the computationally challenging task of recognizing objects despite dramatic variations in retinal input images for a given object (e.g., based on the position or size of the object)?
> a. Across layers, the network learns to represent increasingly complex combinations of features that are also increasingly spatially invariant
> b. The network is reinforced for deep learning across layers via lateral excitatory connections
> c. The network has built-in feature detectors across layers that map retinal inputs across different positions and sizes to the appropriate object representations at the highest level of processing
> d. The network develops activation-based receptive fields that show hierarchical invariance

> Parkinson's patients have reduced levels of dopamine. Dopaminergic medication increases dopamine and "fills in the dips." Why does such medication cause some Parkinson's patients to develop gambling habits? The medication:
> a) reduces all probabilistic learning, so patients have difficulty generalizing to new situations.
> b) shifts the balance of Go and NoGo learning, so that wins count for more, and failures count for less.
> c) leads to less learning about positive outcomes, so that patients seek larger positive outcomes through gambling.
> d) reduces pattern separation in the hippocampus, so that episodic memories of losses blend with episodic memories of wins.

> Dopamine dips:
> a) increase
> b) decrease
> c) do not affect
> 
> - activity of Go pathway neurons in the striatum
> - the strength of associated Go pathway corticostriatal synapses
> - activity of No Go pathway neurons in the striatum
> - the strength of associated No Go pathway corticostriatal synapses

> Why does prefrontal damage (or a less developed prefrontal cortex) affect behavior especially under conditions of conflict? Because conflict is when:
> a) error-driven learning is least likely to be helpful
> b) spatially invariant representations require dopamine-driven learning
> c) pattern completion (via attractor dynamics) is essential for ensuring that goals are kept separate rather than becoming integrated
> d) sustained neuronal firing is needed to bias processing in a way that is different from what the system would tend to do otherwise
