### Global Alignment
What is an alignment?
> Alignment of x and y, resulting in 2 new sequences x' and y' such that |x'| = |y'| AND x' contains either the characters in x as they appear in x OR '\_'. 
> x' removed all '\_' IS x 
> y' removed all '\_' IS y 
> AND x'[i] && y'[i] != '\_' (not both spaces)
> Global alignment is an alignment of x, y such that 
- $\sum^{|x'|}_{i=1} score(x'[i], y'[i])$ is max for all possible alignments. 

For all possible alignments, with sequences x and y, with lengths of x' and y' being n and m:
- Max length is n+rCr, $\frac{(n+r)!}{(n+r-r)!r!}, O(2^n)$

---

$x_1 \dots x_n$
$y_1 \dots y_m$

Maximal alignment is defined as the maximum of:
1) $score(n,m) + OPT(n-1, m-1)$
	- Counting the last letter for both
2) $score(n, \_) + OPT(n-1, m)$
	- Counting n, but using a space for the last char in y
3) $score(\_, m) + OPT(n, m-1)$
	- Counting n, but using a space for the last char in x
OPT(n,m) returns the optimal/max alignment score for sequence $x[1\dots n]$ AND $y[1\dots m]$

*Ex)*
OPT(0,2) for x=ata and y=aaa
- Returnsthe max alignment score for $x[1\dots 0]$ AND $y[1\dots 2]$
	- describing the alignment of x: '' and y: 'aa'
	- best alignment is x: '\_\_' and y: 'aa'
		- = -2 

DP Table for x='ata' and y='aaa


| R   |     |     | a   | a   | a   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     |     | *0* | *1* | *2* | *3* |
|     | *0* | 0   | -1  | -2  | -3  |
| a   | *1* | -1  | 1   | 0   | -1  |
| t   | *2* | -2  | 0   | 0   | -1  |
| a   | *3* | -3  | -1  | 1   | 1   |
- Matrix R stores the OPT scores s.t. - $R[i,j] = OPT(i,j)$
- $OPT(3,2) = x[1\dots 3]$ AND $y[1\dots 2]$
$$
\displaylines{
= max[score(n,m) + OPT(n-1, m-1),\\ 
score(n, \_) + OPT(n-1, m), \\
score(\_, m) + OPT(n, m-1)] \\\\
= max[score(3,2) + OPT(2, 1),\\ 
score(3, \_) + OPT(2, 2), \\
score(\_, 2) + OPT(3, 1)]
}$$
