##### Midterm 1
Sequence alignment
- Global / Local / Semi-global
	- Global: Needlemanâ€“Wunsch algorithm
	- Local: Smith-Waterman
	- Sem
	- Biological uses for each one
- Longest common substring and subsequence
	- How do LCS and global alignment relate?
Blast
Recurrence relations
Runtime analysis (Big-O)
Writing code - Perl and Python
- Working with files, opening/writing/reading
- Regex, matching and replacing

##### Midterm 2
Clustering and Trees
Bayes Method
K-means
De Bruin Graph
- Genome assembly?
Suffix Trees
- Common sequences between paths


##### Post Midterm 2
Hierarchical Clustering
- UPGMA
- Nearest neighbor
- General probability of a path and model combo. 
- Viterbi algo


Ultrametric Tree
- A tree where all leaves are equidistant from the root
- In an ultrametric tree, the two longest distances among any three points must be identical.
- $D(x,y) \leq D(x,z) = D(y,z)$
	- There is no unique maximum, it will repeat
- Matrix M is only ultrametric if the maximum value in any 3 rows is not unique 
UPGMA - Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean
- Go through a matrix combining rows/columns as you combine nodes (species/taxa)
- Combines the 'closest' neighbors iteratively
	- A and B make node AB combined
- With an ultrametric matrix, it will create a tree that is ultrametric and additive 

- Additive trees
	- Use the four point test to test for additivity
![[ECS124-L14 2025-03-04 18.33.05.excalidraw]]
$D_{i,j} + D_{k,l} \leq D_{i,k} + D_{j,l} = D_{i,l} + D_{j,k}$
	- However, can be difficult, because for a matrix with 5 points, you need to test 5 groupings (5 choose 4 = 5)
- Jukes Cantor

Nearest Neighbor?
Neighbor Joining

Hidden Markov Models
*Viterbi*
- The viterbi algorithm is a Dynamic Programming algorithm that uses a hidden markov model and its transitions to find the most likely path to have produced emissions. It iteratively goes through the most likely thing to have emitted a character at every stage, and finds probability for both models
![[Viterbi-Algorithm-Example.png|400]]
- Uses the max probability of arriving to a state, factoring in the immediately preceding state. Linear time, DP, very cool!


|     | A   | B   | C   | D   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A   |     | 8   | 5   | 4   |
| B   |     |     | 7   | 3   |
| C   |     |     |     | 2   |
| D   |     |     |     |     |
Nearest joining:
$D(i,j) = d_{i,j} - r(i) - r(j)$
$r(i) = \frac{1}{n-2}\sum_k d(i,k)$

r(i) = d(A,C) + d(B,C) + d(C,C) + d(D,C)
- 6+7+0+2 = 15 / 2 = 7.5
r(j) = d(A,D) + d(B,D) + d(C,D) + d(D,D)
- 4+3+2 + 0 = 9 / 2 = 4.5
D(C,D) = 2 - 7.5 - 4.5 =  -10



##### UPGMA
|     | A   | B   | C   | D   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A   | 0   | 2   | 4   | 6   |
| B   |     | 0   | 4   | 6   |
| C   |     |     | 0   | 6   |
| D   |     |     |     | 0   |


Heigh of AB is the average of their cluster distance

dist(AB,C) = ( D(A,C) + D(B,C) ) / 2 = 4
dist(AB,D) = ( D(A,D) + D(B,D) ) / 2 = 6

|     | AB  | C   | D   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AB  | 1   | 4   | 6   |
| C   |     | 0   | 6   |
| D   |     |     | 0   |
D(ABC, D) = ( D(AB, D) + D(C, D) ) / 2 = 6
- Distance between old node (AB) and new node (C) to D

|     | ABC | D   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ABC | 2   | 6   |
| D   |     | 0   |
