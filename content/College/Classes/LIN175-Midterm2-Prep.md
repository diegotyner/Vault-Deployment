Linguistics 175 - Quiz 2
### 1. Neuroimaging Techniques
- Spatial vs. Temporal Resolution
	- Know the different "sizes" of spatial resolution:
		- Cortical regions - Larger, more corresponding to lobes
		- Brodmann's areas - Smaller, areas 44 & 45 correspond to broca's area.
		- Single cell recording - Record as small as neurons.
- Comparison of Techniques:
	- MRI
		- Detects blood flow changes
		- Pros: Spatial resolution, non-invasive
		- Cons: Temporal resolution
	- PET
		- Tracks movement of radioactive tracer
		- Pros: Good spatial resolution
		- Cons: Invasive (tracer) and lower temporal  
	- MEG
		- Measures magnetic fields produced by brain
		- Pros: Temporal resolution, non invasive
		- Cons: Not great spatial resolution, susceptible to movement
	- ERP (Event-Related Potentials)
		- Electrical activity on the scalp
		- Pros: Temporal resolution, non invasive, cheap
		- Cons: Bad spatial resolution, noisy
	- NIRS (Near-Infrared Spectroscopy)
		- Measures change in blood oxygenation using near-infrared light
		- Pros: Inexpensive, portable, non invasive
		- Lower spatial and temporal resolution
	- ECOG
		- Electrodes placed on the brain
		- Pros: High spatial and temporal resolution
		- Cons: Very invasive 
	- Neuropsychological testing/Lesion studies
		- Examines cognitive capabilities using tasks
		- Pros: Some of our biggest insights
		- Cons: Not as scientific or controlled
- Spatial: 
	- MRI > MEG > PET > NIRS > ERP
- Temporal:
	- MEG=ERP > fMRI > PET > NIRS
- Populations:
	- fMRI can't be used for people with metal implants very well
	- Claustrophobics no scanners
### 2. Brain Damage & Neuropsychological Testing
- Double Dissociation
- Neuropsychological testing,
- Potential impacts of tumor resection on language function
	- Post-surgical neuropsychological testing
- Aphasia vs. Apraxia
### 3. Brain Stimulation & Cognitive Recovery
- Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS)
- Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)
### 4. Cognitive Neuroscience Methods
- Subtractive Logic in MRI
- Experimental Design Considerations
	- What factors are important in deciding whether the results of a study support your theory?
- Purpose of peer-review journals

### 5. Classical Models of Language Processing
![[Wernicke-Lictheim-Geschwind-Model.png|250]]
- Wernicke-Lichtheim-Geschwind Model:

- Ventral and Dorsal Pathways - Milner and Goodale (1995)
	- Ventral Stream - What.
		-  "*The transformations carried out in the ventral stream permit the formation of perceptual and cognitive representations which embody the enduring characteristics of objects and their significance*"
	- Dorsal Stream - How/Where
		- "*concerned only with the observer's actions within the visual world. The transformations carried out in the dorsal stream, mediate the control of goal-directed actions*"
- What and Where in Language:
![[Language-What-Where-Pathways.png|400]]
	- Ventral Pathway
		- Lexical Conceptual processing (Wernicke's)
	- Dorsal Pathway
		- Sensori-motor/articulation (to Broca's)
		- Doing things with language
- Hickok & Poeppel Model:
![[Dual-Stream-Model-of-Speech-Processing.png|400]]
- Purple is the *ventral stream*
	- Maps the sound structures of words onto the corresponding semantic representations
	- Contributes to forming the integrated meanings of complex utterances like phrases and sentences


- Dual stream vs single stream models
- Review homework 3

Lemma Model:
- Two stages of lexical selection
	- Lexical selection:
		- Conceptual focusing perspective-taking
		- Lexical concept
		- Lemma selection
	- Lemma
	|
	\\/
- Three stages of form encoding
	- Form encoding:
		- Retrieving morphemic phonological codes
		- Phonological codes
		- Prosodification syllabification
		- Phonological word
		- Phonetic encoding
	- Articulatory score
### 6. Visual & Auditory Processing
- Visual Field Processing:
	- Left visual field → right hemisphere
	- Right visual field → left hemisphere
