## 🔶 Course Description
> Registrar:
> Introduction to agent-based computer simulation and analysis with emphasis on learning how to model animals, including humans, to achieve insight into social and group behavior.

### Course Goals
- Learn about complex behavior that emerges from agents following simple rules
- Learn about using virtual experiments to gain an understanding of complex systems and about agent-based models as a specific, practical implementation of virtual experiments
- Gain a basic understanding of how to translate a research question into a design for an agent-based model
- Learn how to program an agent-based model in Java using the MASON library (the amount of programming that you will learn and implement will depend on your objectives for this class)
- Explore several complex natural systems that can be studied using agent-based models
- Learn the fundamentals of analyzing the results of agent-based models for the natural systems that we explore
