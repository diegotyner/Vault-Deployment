## üî∂ Course Description
> Registrar:
> Design and implementation of intelligent computer systems. Knowledge representation and organization. Memory and inference. Problem solving. Natural language processing.

### Professor Description
This course provides an overview of the foundations, problems, approaches, implementation, and applications of artificial intelligence. Topics covered include problem solving, goal-based and adversarial search, logical, probabilistic, and decision theoretic knowledge representation and inference, decision making, and learning. Through programming assignments that sample these topics, students acquire an understanding of what it means to build rational agents of different sorts as well as applications of AI techniques in language processing, planning, vision.¬†The goal of this course is to learn
1. Basic techniques for building intelligent computer systems
2. Search, (games,) constraint satisfaction, uncertainty and probability, Bayes Rule, Na√Øve Bayes, Hidden Markov Models
3. Introduction to fundamental concepts in machine learning: linear regression, linear regression classifier, perceptron learning rule
4. In depth consideration of the role AI will play in our lives

### Textbooks
No textbook is required, and below are the recommended books to read:
- Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, 3rd Edition. Norvig & Russell. The sections on machine learning covered in the course are not in the 2nd Edition. Because this course is a prerequisite for machine learning, the 3rd Edition is recommended over the much cheaper 2nd Edition.
- Speech and Language Processing, 3rd Ed. Jurafsky & Martin.¬†[available online](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/)
