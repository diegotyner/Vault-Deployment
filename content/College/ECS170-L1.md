### What is AI?
Artificial Intelligence - A little ethereal, motivating examples first:
- Deep Blue
- Midjourney
- ChatGPT

### Four Possible Approaches to AI:
1) Thinking Humanly - A cognitive modeling approach to AI. Force machines to work through problems as humans would. Requires approaches from inside the workings of human minds however.
2) Acting Humanly - "Perform actions that require intelligence when performed by people". Extend to perception and action, IE a Turing test. However, not all human behavior involves intelligence.
3) Thinking Rationally - Aristotle version of intelligence. Rational if it does the right thing given what it knows. But, it is not easy to convert knowledge into logical forms, and hard to generalize it to complex problems. 
4) Acting Rationally - Doing the right or useful thing to achieve the best outcome.
