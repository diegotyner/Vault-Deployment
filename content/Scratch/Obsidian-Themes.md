### Themes
So far I've liked:
- The default, but it's a bit hard on the eyes how the inside is darker than the outside
- [Obsidian Things](https://github.com/colineckert/obsidian-things), I'm really liking it. I need to learn [[Thing's-Features]] though
- Atom, pretty good, but doesn't have the same features as things. Has the smooth look of a *Mac* app.
- Prisma looked interesting, had text highlighting blocks like callout, but less clunky. Very cool, but I don't need it. Form should follow function, and my function is unencumbered at the moment
