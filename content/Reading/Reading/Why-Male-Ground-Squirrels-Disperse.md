# Why Male Ground Squirrels Disperse: A multilevel analysis explains why only males leave home

---

## 🎤 Vocab
**Philopatric** - the tendency of an animal to remain in or return to the area of its birth
**Ontogeny** - the development or course of development especially of an individual organism


## ❗ Information
[Link](https://www.jstor.org/stable/27855724)

At around two months old, "male Belding's ground squirrels (*Spermophilus beldingi*)" leave the burrow they were born in. Females do not do this

> [!question] Why do males, and only males disperse?





## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
**Dispersal** - Complete and permanent emigration from an individual's home range.
- A vast majority of organisms have this behavior in some form
#### Reasons for Dispersal
1) Breeding dispersal - "movement of adults between reproductive episodes"
2) Natal dispersal - "emigration of young from their birthplace"
Natal dispersal occurs in virtually all birds and mammals before first reproduction
- Males emigrate in most mammals, females are *philopatric*
- Vice versa in birds

#### Narrowing the question
The general question "Why does animal A exhibit trait X" is a large and confusing one for biologists.
> In 1961, Mayr proposed that causal explanations in biology be grouped into proximate and ultimate categories.
- **Proximate**: day-to-day lives of individuals
- **Ultimate**: Evolutionary, encompassing multiple generations
Tinbergen later continued Mayr's work.
- Proximate explanations can be subdivided into ontogenic and physiological explanations
- Ultimate explanations require understanding the behaviors evolutionary origins and reproductive effects
	- Evolutionary phylogenetic history vs fitness 
This framework posits that hypothesis should seek to explain within the frameworks of the four levels of analysis, and that "at least four 'correct' answers" about causality can exist.

#### The study
Studied three populations of *S. beldingi* near Yosemite between 1974 and 1985. Trapped ground squirrels aboveground to sample them. Measure their distance from home burrow to quantify dispersal. 
- For males, they would venture farther and farther from home burrow, before returning to home in the evening. Eventualy, they wouldn't return and restrict activities to their new range, having dispersed from home territory. From this point, they often move further, always farther from their birthplace.  
- Specific numbers can be found in the paper itself, including age of dispersion, distance, fitness, etc.

#### Physiological Mechanisms
Given the difference between the development of males and females, they experimented with gonadectomies. These had little effect.
Next they exposed them them to androgens, which induced dispersing behavior in female pups. 
This suggests an organizational role in steroids in sexual differentiation of *S. beldingi*. 
- Authors note that in mammals are XX and males are XY, while in birds this is reversed. This tracks with the development of dispersal behavior. 

#### Ontogenetic processes
The onset of dispersal is triggered by changes in internal or external environment.
##### External
- It is not caused by aggression from peers, as this does not occur to males more than females, and no increase at the time of dispersal
	- No evidence for social aggressiveness as a hypothesis
- No evidence to support a relation to avoidance of littermates or mother either. 
Instead, they posit an internal explanation
##### Internal
Ontogenetic switch hypothesis: Males will disperse when they attain a high enough body mass. This predicts that dispersers will have different pattern of weight gains than philopatric peers.
- This is supported by data, emigration usually occurs around 125g for males.
- They float the idea that it could be fat stores, and not directly body weight

#### Fitness
Hypothesized benefits of dispersal for males:
- Avoiding shortages of foods or burrows.
	- Authors arrived at conclusion that there is little link between food shortages and dispersal.
	- Burrow availability wasn't found either, dispersal not significantly related to population density or burrow availability
- Parasites or diseases
	- Found low vulnerability anyways. No direct investigation
- Competition for mates
	- Found no advantage to dispersing at increasing availability to females
- Family incest
	- This was found to be most likely explanation, ties in with the nonrandom movement of dispersing males.
Likely females don't disburse, as there is more advantage to protecting high quality burrows. This relation doesn't exist for non parental males.

#### Evolutionary
Male dispersal is a very common trait, and can be observed in all *Spermophilus* species studied. Also in ancestors. The ubiquity of the trait suggests it is advantageous.
