### Scratch Notes:
#### Abstract
PET is used as neuro imager.
Task is sentence completion and melody completion in amateur musicians.
##### Core Areas:
Melodic Completion: 
- Left BA44, Right BA45 (44/45 is Broca's)
- Bilateral Temporal Planum Polare (BA 22 - Wernicke's)
- Lateral BA6 (Premotor)
- pre-SMA (supplementary motor area) (BA 6, 6ab??)
Sentence Completion:
- Bilateral posterior superior and middle temporal cortex (BA 22/21) (22 is Wernicke's, 21 is below in Medial temporal gyrus)
- Left BA39 (visual cortex?)
- Bilateral Superior Frontal (BA 8/9) (8: frontal eye fields and 9: frontal cortex)
- Left inferior Frontal (BA 44/45, Broca's)
- Anterior Cingulate (ACC) (associated with BA 24/32/33)
	- "higher-level functions, such as attention allocation, reward anticipation, decision-making, impulse control (e.g. performance monitoring and error detection), and emotion" - [src](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cingulate_cortex)
- pre-SMA (supplementary motor area) (BA 6, 6ab??)

Activations found in nearly identical brain areas:
- M1, SMA, Broca's, Anterior Insula, A1 (BA 1), A2 (BA 22), Temporal Pole (BA 38), Basal Ganglia, Ventral Thalamus, Posterior Cerebellum
These commonalities can be explained by: 
- Component sharing
- Interleaved representations
- Adaptive coding
The authors then propose a model of shared, parallel, and distinctive features of each task. They assume:
> that music and language show parallel combinatoric generativity for complex sound structures (phonology) but distinctly different informational content (semantics).

The differences were found in lateralization, language favored the left hemisphere. 




#### Subjects
5M and 5F out of 36 possible amateur musicians
Mean is 25 years (19-46)
Strongly right handed
No meds, neurological or psychiatric illness
All university students, most music majors
- Began at average of 12.4 years, average of 12.6 years before study
- No perfect pitch
Study of imitative singing that was a previous study (all 36)
Screening:
 - Sing back 35 samples of monophonic (one channel / only melody) melodies they had to sing back
 - 26 samples of chordal melodies who they had to harmonize with
Inclusion Criteria:
1) Proficiency at singing in key
2) Sing at least 50% of repetition sample perfectly
3) Sing at least 50% of harmonization sample, shadowing melody perfectly

#### Task
Melody: 
- 6s melody - 6s response - 1s intertrial interval
- Consecutive samples never in same key
Sentence:
- 4s sentence - 4s response - 1s intertrial interval
Rest with eyes closed

> Therefore, a sense of finality (e.g. a return to a pitch from the tonic chord in the melody task) was sought in the generated output. 





#### Results

> Regions of BA 22 and BA 44 ⁄ 45 are seen as sensory and motor centres, respectively, for phonological generativity. These areas of parallelism may be localized such that BA 22 ⁄ 44 ⁄ 45 of the left hemisphere is specialized for speech phonology and the corresponding right hemispheric areas are specialized for musical phonology.
