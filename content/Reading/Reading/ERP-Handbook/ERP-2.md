### Waveform Peaks versus Underlying EPR Components
Superposition problem, a degree of uncertainty
#### Rule 1
> Peaks and components are not the same thing. There is nothing special about the point at which the voltage in the observed waveform reaches a local maximum
#### Rule 2
> It is impossible to estimate the time course or peak latency of an underlying ERP component by looking at a single ERP waveform — there may be no obvious relationship between the shape of a local part of the waveform and the underlying components.

#### Rule 3
> An effect during the time period of a particular peak may not reflect a modulation of the underlying component that is usually associated with that peak.

To check, you can look at the scalp distribution of the difference wave, and see if the dipole is too complex for one dipole.
Also, check early and late part of the wave. If they are different, then you have at least two components.

#### Rule 4
> Differences in peak amplitude do not necessarily correspond with differences in component size, and differences in peak latency do not necessarily correspond with changes in component timing

#### Rule 5
> Never assume that an averaged ERP waveform directly represents the individual waveforms that were averaged together. In particular, the onset and offset times in the averaged waveform represent the earliest onsets and latest offsets from the individual trials or individual subjects that contribute to the average.


#### Rule 6
> An ERP effect observed in one experiment may not reflect the same underlying brain activity as an effect of the same polarity and timing in previous experiments.
