# 📗 -> Computational rationality: A converging paradigm for intelligence in brains, minds, and machines
[Link]([Computational rationality: A converging paradigm for intelligence in brains, minds, and machines | Science](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aac6076))
## 🎤 Vocab


## ❗ Information
The paper described how the fields of AI, cognitive science, and neuroscience are reconverging in the pursuit of computational intelligence. 

They describe advances in "representations and inferential procedures for large-scale probabilistic inference and machinery for enabling reflection and decisions about tradeoffs in effort, precision, and timeliness of computations."

## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
- People are not rational agents, we have our own biases and limitations. One of our greatest is our limitation of computing time, and inherent laziness. 
> First, maximizing some measure of expected utility provides a general-purpose ideal for decision-making under uncertainty. Second, maximizing expected utility is nontrivial for most real-world problems, necessitating the use of approximations. Third, the choice of how best to approximate may itself be a decision subject to the expected utility calculus—thinking is costly in time and other resources, and sometimes intelligence comes most in knowing how best to allocate these scarce resources.
