> _This [series](https://www.thetransmitter.org/open-neuroscience-and-data-sharing/) of scientist-written essays explores the benefits and challenges of data-sharing and open-source technologies in neuroscience._


## 🎤 Vocab
## ❗ Information
[Data literacy workshop](https://lrwyatt.github.io/Research-Project-Workshops-2017/)

Data validation, metadata and stable file formats. are all key parts of data literacy. Data handling and data sharing are interconnected, as to do one, one must keep in mind the other. 


## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
> I also made a point to show students how data-handling and data-sharing are intimately connected. To effectively share data, the researcher must, in a sense, “reverse engineer” a data-handling plan, thinking ahead to the prospective experimental outcomes in order to define data types, standards, formatting and other factors.
