## 🎤 Vocab


## ❗ Information
Methods and techniques for experimentation have advanced dramatically. 
The not-for-profit movement has led to a number of improvements, but the same trend is not true of many laboratory equipments.
They launched the OpenBehavior project in 2016 to address this.

> In response to these issues, researchers have developed their own tools, such as [Bonsai](https://bonsai-rx.org/) and [pyControl](https://github.com/pyControl), which use modern hardware and programming interfaces. They have also developed powerful programs for video analysis, including [DeepLabCut](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut) and [SLEAP](https://github.com/talmolab/sleap), which have capabilities beyond those of commercial vendors. Scientists have also created devices that offer functions not available commercially, such as the Feeding Experimentation Device ([FED](https://github.com/KravitzLabDevices/FED3)) for home-cage training mice in operant tasks.



## ✒️ -> Scratch Notes
- One reason for the lack of adoption is the barrier to entry. Many require high technical literacy in coding and electronics.

> online courses could address the technical skills gap. For example, courses in computer programming, electronics and 3D printing could be tailored to the specific needs of neuroscientists. The [CAJAL Advanced Neuroscience Training Programme](https://cajal-training.org/) and [Neuromatch Academy](https://academy.neuromatch.io/) offer training on current methods, including optogenetics and computational neuroscience. New offerings from these programs could be a great way to deliver content to a wide audience and perhaps accelerate the adoption of new methods into research labs.
