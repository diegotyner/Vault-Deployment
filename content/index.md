# Hey!

![[Sleeping_Kitty.jpg | 200]]

Welcome to my website! This is an online deployment of my Obsidian Vault using [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz).
Below I've linked some #Hub pages that lead to most of my notes. 

Quick tips before you get started:
- You can find search for pages directly with Cmd/Ctrl + k
	- I love fuzzy finding!
- You can preview a page by hovering over it
	- *This can also tell you if I haven't made the page yet*
- I'd recommend switching to the dark mode, I've configured more of the colors for that:
	- [[Obsidian-Themes|Colors]]
- Throughout my vault, you'll see code blocks at the top of the page with headers that say "Dataview". Ignore these, those are personal automations in my vault.
