### 🎤 Vocab
[Geometric Deep Learning - This article defines a number of terms well](https://www.freedium.cfd/https://medium.com/aiguys/geometric-deep-learning-introduction-46ff511e0bac)
*Curse of Dimensionality:* As the number of dimensions to a problem grows, the number of data points necessary to extrapolate a meaningful solution grows exponentially
*Kernels:* A filter that applies to input data to change its representation (think the outputted hotspots for MNIST PCA)
*Representation:* The way that data is mapped internally. Think about the warped way that our visual cortex represents an image (more space devoted to fovea)

> [!NOTE] Categories
> Machine Learning is generally categorized into three types: Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement learning
### Supervised:
#### Classification - Discrete Classification
In classification problems the machine must learn to predict discrete values. That is, the machine must predict the most probable category, class, or label for new examples. Applications of classification include predicting whether a stock's price will rise or fall, or deciding if a news article belongs to the politics or leisure section. 
- Predict gender from shoulder / waist sizes.

#### [[Regression]] - Value Prediction
In regression problems the machine must predict the value of a continuous response variable. Examples of regression problems include predicting the sales for a new product, or the salary for a job based on its description.
- Predict house price

### Unsupervised:
When we have unclassified and unlabeled data, the system attempts to uncover patterns from the data . There is no label or target given for the examples. One common task is to group similar examples together called clustering.
- Group and separate unlabeled songs

### Reinforcement Learning (RL):
Attempting to maximize a goal. Feedback is given to an agent / model.
- Maximize points in a game
