# 📗 -> Regularization
## 🎤 Vocab
**L2 or Ridge Regularization** - The L2 penalty aims to minimize the squared magnitude of the weights
- Pneumonic could be the 2 in L2 stands for squared
- $\frac{\lambda}{2n} \sum^n \limits_{j=1}w_j^2$

**L1 or Lasso** - The L1 penalty aims to minimize the absolute value of the weights
- Pneumonic could be that the 1 means the power of 1 is penalized
- $\frac{\lambda}{2n} \sum^n \limits_{j=1}|w_j|$

**Hyperparameters:**  
> Hyper-parameters are “higher-level” parameters that describe structural information about a model that must be decided before fitting model parameters, examples of hyper-parameters we discussed so far: 
> - Learning rate alpha , Regularization lambda.



## ❗ Information
Regularization is a method to discourage [[Overfitting|overfitting]]


### Difference between L1 and L2:
L2 shrinks all coefficients, but does not eliminate them
L1 can eliminate them (shrink to zero). It performs feature selection
