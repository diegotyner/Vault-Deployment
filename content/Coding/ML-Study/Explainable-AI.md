# 📗 -> Explainable AI


## ❗ Information
> Explainable AI, or XAI for short 
> - Prof H. Pirsiavash


A very important field of study, learning how AI makes decisions and understanding them is not just a scientific pursuit, but a practical one. A diagnosis AI is infinitely more useful if we can understand *how* and *why* it arrives at its decisions. 

I'm interested in this mainly because of my interest in the brain, and developing intelligent systems. Understanding the decision-making of AI at a deeper level is the first step to improving it. To pursue this, I'm also studying the alternative angle of studying the intelligent system that is the brain. Both are massive sink holes of information, but a satisfying start is doing work in Explainable AI.

This is a massive topic of study, with a number of resources on the matter:
