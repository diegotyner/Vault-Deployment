## ðŸ§¾ Project Description
### Blurt
I would love to practice actually talking in spanish more. My biggest problem is I don't hear/speak/practice it enough, so making something to practice it more. I've heard that the voice chat mode on ChatGPT is one of the best resources available, so if I could emulate that for free, I would be super happy.

Chatbot for learning language? Speech recognition -> LLM -> TTS?
