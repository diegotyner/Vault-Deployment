## ðŸ§¾ Project Description
### Blurt
This project will center around RAG and word vectorization. I'm very interested about working it in to analyze large chunks of text, especially to get insight from them. This could be expanded to a number of domains, like potentially the symposium proceedings? We'll see!

On top of that, I routinely have to catch up on a large batch of content! (skipping class for 2 weeks). It would be great to have hints to know where to start my studying, and have hints for which lectures are most informative / content rich.

I want to create a project that highlights relevant course content through text parsing techniques
The class resources we are offered are:
- Class slide show PDFs
- Lecture transcripts
- Textbooks, etc.
Would word vectorization, RAG, or some other approach be good for doing this? Should I create different data pipelines for slide shows, transcripts and textbooks? What else should I consider?
