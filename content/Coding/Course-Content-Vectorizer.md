## ðŸ§¾ Project Description
### Blurt
This project will center around RAG and word vectorization. I'm very interested about working it in to analyze large chunks of text, especially to get insight from them. This could be expanded to a number of domains, like potentially the symposium proceedings? We'll see!

On top of that, I routinely have to catch up on a large batch of content! (skipping class for 2 weeks). It would be great to have hints to know where to start my studying, and have hints for which lectures are most informative / content rich.

Automated pushing to Google drive. Lectures should be hosted there, not on vps


```
postgres=# CREATE TABLE lectures (
    lecture_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    class TEXT,  -- URL/filepath
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    metadata JSONB  -- author, date, tags, etc.
);
postgres=# CREATE TABLE chunks (
    chunk_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    lecture_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES lectures(lecture_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    embedding VECTOR(384),  -- Dimension matches MiniLM-L6-v2
    position INT,  -- Original order in lecture
    metadata JSONB,  -- page numbers, timestamps, etc.
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
