This one is kind of dead in the water because.... 
*i could just use notion 🥲*

The appeal here is to just not have to rely on notion, and instead have a static app that I could easily display. We'll see if I ever put the time aside to do it though!


## 🧾 Project Description
This project seems pretty easy in all honesty. It's going to be two pronged, a Next.js app that can edit the pages, and a separate static app ([[Astro]] or [[Next.js]]?) that can read my saved files and display them to the user. I was thinking that I would style them a la Notion, and would make it a sort of couple blog.

I already had the idea to do it with a main editor, and save it as either MD or JSON (the scheme is somewhat described by this Chat GPT log, [[Notion-Blog-GPT-Log]]). I'm leaning towards JSON but MD seems to be standard, and I might warm up to it. I need to figure out how to format the split view blocks though. 

## 🎯 Objective
The objective is just to start a pretty blog. Doing a blog sounds painful though, so I wanted to make it fun and quirky, with notion styled editing.

### 🗣️ Blurt
This project sounds like a lot of fun, but I can't justify working on it. I need to have a real AI project ASAP, and this is just more Next.js muckery that I'm sure to get stuck in the weeds with. The idea is somewhat cool, but will have to remain in the backlog.

I could also just use Notion in the first place lol
