At the moment im hosting my personal website as this quartz deployment.
Notes for that:
- Light theming as cajal/golgi staining inspired
	- Parchment base: FCF5E5
	- Coral pink / red highlights: F88379
- Dark theming as immunoflorouerscence inspired

### Published:
> WARNING: Do not look at deployment. It is bad atm.

Deployment 
- https://diego-tyner.vercel.app/
GitHub
- https://github.com/diegotyner/Portfolio



### Blurt
I don't want that much out of it to be honest, I just want to be able to hand people a link to it and have them see my projects so we can chat. Maybe its more for personal fulfillment in that sense, nobodies really going to want to see that.  Either way, having a central hub of things that I'm willing to display is cool to me (and it can't be GitHub that's too intense).



> [!NOTE] NEW IDEA
> Brain / Neuron Themed Portfolio


> [!NOTE] new NEW IDEA
> Navigate around it like quartz. Node map, can whisk around, see neurons populate. Make it snappy, make it fun.

Add the bookshelf idea, a virtual bookshelf of books ive read where if you hover/click you can see my review of the book

### Effects / Animations:
- Hovering over something FIRES a neuron
	- The navigation fires a neuron, exposing other neurons that have content
	- Words form from axons? Coming in one after another
- Connectivity
- Growing / Synapsing
	- Maybe lines shoot out from the middle and grow into text boxes?
- Floating aesthetic, things bubble around like they're in a pool. Parallax 
	- Check saved designs insta 

- Sidebar that turns into navbar on mobile

- The text fades in and out, as if its being *maintained* by neuron firing

- I like this effect, generate it?

> [!NOTE] Dealing with text
> The text is going to be fairly cramped, if the website is connected by neurons. 
> 	What if the neurons fire to navigate, and depending on whats active, different "thought" text gets put into a central thing, like a brain?

Neurons circling around the text field?
Intro animation with neurons bubbling inside brain, then exploding outwards

Neurons pop like a balloon when activated
- blow up and reveal text
- connected neurons fire at same time

### Inspiration:
- [HackDavis 2024](https://hackdavis.io)
	- I like the soft theming
- [Codelab](https://www.codelabdavis.com/)
	- There's a bunch of fun motion effects
- [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/?utm_source=view-page&utm_medium=logo-nav)
	- Color theming is very pretty
- [Dribble Example](https://dribbble.com/shots/23603435-Tech-Logo-From-Portfolio)
	- Interesting abstraction of neurons
- [Quarts Docs](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/), [Jacky (jzhao) Portfolio](https://jzhao.xyz/)
	- Love the little connections in the corner, navigating like that could be fun!
	- Also just very cozy, and the personality melts through. Would love to emulate.

### Possible Themes
- Train a stable diffusion to create your background
- Impressionist?
- Paper collage
- transcending medium 
- long flowy overgrown grass

- Sleek/Web 4.0?
- Text to speech?
- Digital Garden?
- RANDOMNESS
- "Mice are overated. Take a break."
	- Navigate different pages with the keyboard 
	- Maybe glasses in the navbar showing which is being viewed?


### Existing
An outline of things that I want to show off like
- My interests
- My classwork
- My projects



### Todo
Make it pretty
Maybe make it impressionist?
Maybe do it in [[Astro]]? That could be cool
