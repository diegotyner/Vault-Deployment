## ðŸ§¾ Project Description
### Blurt
Im interested in doing a couple sports analytics projects for the nba ( a quick project to get familiar with nba teams fast so I can catch up with the league, maybe a website with team stat data, age, heat maps, player shot charts, etc.) Where can i find this type of data?
