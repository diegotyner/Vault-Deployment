## 🧾 Project Description
### SHRDLU
The idea is to remake the concept behind Blocks World, a historical achievement in AI where a text interface was used to command a robot to manipulate a real 3D space. It's infamously known for being far more complicated than expected. I want to redo it with text embedding, and try my hand at it. I don't know exactly how I'd go about it, but man it's tempting to show those old timers how its done. 

I would want to code my own NLP interface from scratch, implementing word embeddings and somehow training it to output commands to a 'robot arm'. Later though, this is far in the backlog.
