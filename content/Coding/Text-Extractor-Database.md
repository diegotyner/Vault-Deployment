## ðŸ§¾ Project Description

### Blurt
This is a continuation of the [[Course-Content-Vectorizer]], I want to make a tool with which I can search through a large corpus of text to find relevant passages, and resources.

To do this, im going to tackle it in stages:
##### Part 1:
Resource scraping. I already did a part of this with the [[Course-Content-Vectorizer]], but now I want to extend it to parsing PDFs, and maybe scraping text from youtube playlists too?
##### Part 2:
Set up a text extraction pipeline. I want to support smart text extraction, vectorization, and search for:
- Raw transcripts
- Lecture Slides
- Research Paper pdfs
- and more as I come up with things I want to put in the DB!
##### Part 3:
A easy to distribute and download frontend!
I plan on doing this through Tauri
