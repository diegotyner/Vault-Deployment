- Or maybe not an LLM, but a crawler that will go and make you review and clean up notes? IE
	- Crawls notes and looks for notes that dont have "reviewed: true" yaml tag. Allow customization, specifying regex or tags for file names you want to review, like "~= m/ECS" or something to that effect 
	- Go run the crawler once a week, and review the notes. Forces you to go through lectures for the week for example. Force me to fill in the "Refresh the info" section
