### Blurt
A app to stop you from forgetting and letting them pass. Lot of analogies to a river, help ideas float to the surface, don let be dead wood drifting pass
- quick notes that you can somehow see later
	- Ideas float to surface later
	- see themes in your writing 
		- Tags?
		- Transformers?
			- Searching for notes
			- Creating tags, linking notes?
	- Maybe as your writing you see similar notes?
		- 

Top notes is a random note from before, maybe see a top bumped note from before
- rate how much you still care about an idea, bump it up or down.
