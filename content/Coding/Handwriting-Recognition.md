## ðŸ§¾ Project Description
### Blurt
I wanted a little text extractor for when its too annoying to highlight PDF text. 

I might want to extend it to actually extract text/notes!
- Send images to a flagship LLM 
	- e
- Maybe use the extracted text to make some sort of knowledge management application?
	- Notion database?
	- Obsidian?
	- Class folders? 


```DeepSeek
1. User Uploads Handwritten Note
    - Mobile/web app captures image â†’ uploads to Firebase Storage or directly to Notion.
2. OCR Processing
    - Use Google Cloud Vision (free tier) or Tesseract (free, less accurate) to extract text.
3. LLM Structuring
    - Send text to GPT-3.5 to:
        - Generate a title, summary, and tags.
        - Identify related notes (for backlinks).        
4. Save to Notion/Firebase
    - Create a Notion page or Firestore document with structured data.    
5. Update Vector DB
    - Generate embeddings for the note â†’ store in Pinecone/Chroma.    
6. Semantic Search
    - Users query notes via text â†’ search vector DB for matches
```

Maybe I could even tie it into [[Obsidian-LLM-Integration]]?
