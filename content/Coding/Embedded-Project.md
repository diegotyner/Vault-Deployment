## 🧾 Project Description
It would be fun to venture into the real world with some sort of embedded project. I've liked the feeling of creating something more tangible like a website, but now I can't help but feel like a soy JS dev. I want to code something real, code something in C, prove that I can handle a real embedded system project. Now all that's left is to decide what that would be lmao. 

I need to look into creating something with Arduino or Raspberry Pi.
