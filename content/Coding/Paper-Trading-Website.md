## 🧾 Project Description
I've been growing more and more curious of the stock market, and if I could make money if I went and tried my hand at it. So what better way to learn than to research all about it by writing a website about the market? 

They seem like they should be very important, and as cringe as it is, day traders do seem cool to me. So, I want to research into it, develop a website that lets me quickly navigate around and investigate things, and facilitate my learning. This is fairly low priority though, so I won't be starting on this immediately.
