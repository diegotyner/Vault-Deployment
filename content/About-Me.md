# Hi There!

I'm **Diego Tyner**, a third year student at UC Davis double majoring in *Computer Science* and *Cognitive Science*, with a minor in *Neuroscience*. 

### *I love* 
- Neural systems, I'm looking to learn all about [[_ML-Study|deep learning]] and how to build intelligent systems through the [[_Brain|brain]].
- Putting together websites, being able to share things on the internet is awesome! 

Check back in with me later, maybe I'll have a cooler [[Portfolio|website]] to show off!
### What am I working on? ðŸ¤”
Right now, I'm working as a web developer for the Forage lab on campus, and I'm working as a PM for [[Neurotech|Davis Neurotech]], leading a project on EEG inference of eyewitness testimony.

On top of that, I have a couple [[Projects|projects]] that I want to work on:  
- A machine learning program to recommend songs - [[Music-Recommender]]  
- A [[Transplantable-SNN|transplantable neural network]], where you train neural networks separately then combine them together later.  
- An android app: Minimalist Phone. I'd love to cut back on screen time, and the official app is paid only. Will try to make myself soon.
- I want to learn [[Astro]], maybe I'll try making a [[Notion-Blog]]?
### What have I done?
