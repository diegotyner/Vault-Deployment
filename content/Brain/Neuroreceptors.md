# 📗 -> Name
## ❗ Information
Need to fill out from my notes from NPB 100
Here's a [relevant lecture](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/886781/files/folder/Lectures?preview=23840298) for later



## 📄 Description 
### NMDA:
Blocked by Magnesium (Mg2+), needs to be unblocked by a significant rise in membrane voltage
Lets in Calcium (Ca2+), which plays a critical role in [[Learning|learning]] and neuroplasticity.

### AMPA:
Receives glutamate
Lets in Sodium (Na+) and is one of the biggest workhorses in the brain
> Its name is derived from its ability to be activated by the artificial glutamate analog AMPA

### GABA Receptor:
Plays a big role in inhibition, receptive to GABA

### VGCCs:
Voltage Gated Calcium Channels, channels that only open when the membrane potential is elevated. Less impactful to calcium levels that NMDA


## 🌎 Location
- A post synaptic neuron?
	- Does a pre synaptic neuron have one? I don't think so, should come back

## 🧪 Example
- Define examples where it can be used
