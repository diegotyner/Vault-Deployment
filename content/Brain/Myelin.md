# ðŸ“— -> Myelin


## ðŸ“„ Description 
- Fatty sheaths that cover the axon to improve the conductance of the axon. This is partly why the inside of the brain (the white matter) is white, its fattier and more well myelinated because the neurons have to travel farther and faster. 
- The myelin sheathing leaves gaps for conductance to jump across, these are called nodes of Ranvier
> \[The nodes of Ranvier are a\] periodic gap in the insulating sheath (myelin) on the axon of certain neurons that serves to facilitate the rapid conduction of nerve impulses

## ðŸŒŽ Location
- Along the axon of a neuron
