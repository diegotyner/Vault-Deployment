- [ ] Research White Matter Tracts
- [ ] Research Brain Networks
- [ ] Put in a section called visual processing, that lists all the sections of the visual network pipeline and what they do (V1, V2/V4, ...)
- [ ] Finish filling in information from [[CCN_Book_Ch5]]. A lot of good info there.
- [ ] Create pages for each frequency band and their associations


> [!tip] Mission Statement
I want to create a fun map of the brain to facilitate my learning, I want to tie things together spatially and functionally.


Some old notes: [Brain Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cb6ALEfRYf-rtFlw-RnPXQnMgwnjpTpnUgrS0q2_N9c/edit?usp=sharing)
# Underlying Biology
### Cells
[[Neurons]]
[[Dendrites]]
[[Axon|Axons]]
[[Myelin]]
[[Glia]]

### Processes
[[Synaptic-Plasticity]]
[[Neurotransmitters]]
[[Neuroreceptors]]
[[Hormones]]

### Layers
Six Layers of Cortex


## Brain Structure:
### Major Regions (lobes, etc.)
[[Frontal-Lobe]]
[[Temporal-Lobe]]
[[Parietal-Lobe]]
[[Occipital-Lobe]]
[[Cerebral-Cortex]]
[[Cerebral-Subcortex]]
[[Brainstem]]
[[Spinal-Cord]]

### Regions
[[Gross-Anatomy]]
[[Brain-Areas]]
Add Brodmann's?

[[Anki-New-Areas]]
# Functional
### Lower Level
[[Memory]]
[[Learning]]
[[Hormone-Regulation]]
[[Automated-Functions]]
[[Sensory-Information]]
[[Motor-Function]]
[[Vision]]
[[Olfaction]]

### Higher Level
[[Decision-Making]]
[[Thought]]
[[Emotion]]
[[Language]]
- [[LIN175-Neurological-Substrates-of-Language]]
	- Wernicke's / Broca's Areas
- Connect to talk about representation
[[Human-Development]] 
- Talk about young synaptic genesis, adult pruning etc
- Grey/White matter graphs
- Timeline of ages with milestones / age markers (first words, walking etc.)


## Brain Networks / Pathways
[[Default-Mode-Network]]
[[Executive-Control-Network]]
[[Salience-Network]]
- [[Toward-A-Taxonomy-Of-Large-Scale-Brain-Networks]]

> [!NOTE] 
> Visual Network -> Occipital Network (ON)
> Motor / Somatomotor Network -> Pericentral Network (PN)
> Attention Network -> Dorsal Frontoparietal Network (D-FPN)
> Control Network -> Lateral Frontoparietal Network (L-FPN)
> Salience Network -> Midcingulo-insular Network (M-CIN)
> 	- Leave the salience guesswork out it
Default Mode -> Medial Frontoparietal Network (M-FPN)

[[Arcuate-Fasciculus]]?

## Frequency Bands
[[Delta-Band]]
[[Theta-Band]]
[[Alpha-Band]]
[[Beta-Band]]
[[Gamma-Band]]
[[ERP-Components]]


## Recording techniques?
