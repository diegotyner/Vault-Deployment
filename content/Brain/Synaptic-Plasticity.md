# 📗 -> Synaptic Plasticity


## ❗ Information
One of the most central ideas in all of neuroscience, this provides the mechanism for the brain to adapt and learn.

## 📄 Description 
- 

This also encompasses Hebbian Learning:
- A synaptic property that “cells that fire together wire together”. 
- You can induce increased responsiveness by first doing a weak stimulus (WS), followed by strong stimulus (SS), then WS again. You will notice stronger responsiveness. 
- It is postulated that proteins are needed to modify the synapse. (certain chemicals can inhibit the learning is why)
