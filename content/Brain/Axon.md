# ðŸ“— -> Name


## ðŸ“„ Description 
- One axon to a neuron (usually). This axon can branch off, but can all be traced back to one root. VERY useful for identifying visually. 
- These axons can be thought of as the output of the neuron. Send signals to the next neuron.
- When an [[Action-Potential|action potential]] is triggered, there will be a cascade of neurotransmitters. The axon hillock is the place most sensitive to triggering this, as the neurotransmitters do not dilute as much travelling to the hillock to attempt to trigger a spike. 

## ðŸŒŽ Location
- The 'tail' of a neuron.
