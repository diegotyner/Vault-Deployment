# 📗 -> Neurotransmitters


## ❗ Information
Neurotransmitters are one of the primary ways our brain sends signals!!
Chemical synapses use the transfer of transmitter from the pre-synaptic cell to the post-synaptic cell. 
The neurotransmitters will interact with [[Neuroreceptors|neuroreceptors]] to send this signal

## 📄 Description 
This is a broad category, as there are literally 100s of neurotransmitters. Some major ones include:
-  Glutamate
	- The most abundant transmitter
	- Excitatory
	> >Imbalances in glutamate levels are associated with Alzheimer’s disease, dementia, Parkinson’s disease and seizures.
- GABA (Gamma-aminobutyric acid)
	- Inhibitory
	>> prevents problems in the areas of anxiety, irritability, concentration, sleep, seizures and depression.
- Dopamine
	- Originates primarily in the Substantia Nigra and the VTA
	- Known as the "feel good" hormone, gives you a sens eof pleasure / satisfaction
	- Critical part of the brains reward system, dopamine modulation is the key component of the RPE, or the "Reward Prediction Error". This determines how satisfied you are with a choice.
- Serotonin
	- Helps regulate mood, body temperature and appetite. 
	-  "95% of the body's serotonin, however, is produced in the intestine"  
	- In the brain, its almost exclusively produced in the raphe nuclei located in the midline of the brainstem
- Oxytocin
	- Create in the hypothalamus, but your posterior pituitary gland stores and releases it into your bloodstream
	> > Oxytocin is released in response to activation of sensory nerves during labor, breastfeeding and sexual activity

- Glycine
- Histamine
- Epinephrine / Norepinephrine
- Acetylcholine
- Adrenaline / Noradrenaline
